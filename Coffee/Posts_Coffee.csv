8,2,,2015-01-27T20:50:57.833,15,,"<p>Let's start off with what the function of the tamp is.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xt7gz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>Function</h2>

<p>The tamp is cylindrical in shape and is ideally just snug enough to fit into the portafilter smoothly. What the tamp does, is prime the coffee bed to be met with water. What we know about the water is that in general, in commercial machines, water is applied with 9 bars of pressure. Physics tells us that pressured water flow will take the path of least resistance. By this logic, the tamp functions by making the coffee bed smooth, even, and robust enough to be hit with 9 bars of pressure and extract evenly. </p>

<h2>Barista Health</h2>

<p><em>Note: In no way am I a qualified physician. This is not to be considered medical advice.</em></p>

<p>If the surface one tamps on is on the proper level, the barista should be able to tamp with their elbo at a 90 degree(ish) angle, and their wrists in a semi-straight path to prevent damage. The barista can then use their body weight, and not muscle, to perform the tamp. By leaning into the tamp with the correct path, one can achieve about 30lbs of pressure. </p>

<h2>Experiments with varying pressure</h2>

<p>Personally I have experimented with varying pressured tamps and have found that applying a greater pressure than 30 lbs produced little effect, at most, a longer extraction. There are other variables that should be adjusted instead, such as the grind size, to achieve such an effect.</p>

<p>That is to say it will definitely affect flavor, but how it affects the flavor is ultimately dependent upon the specific mineral compounds found in your hard water vs. other hard waters and soft water's lack of these compounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's the key: Some of the compounds in hard water are &quot;sticky,&quot; glomming onto certain compounds in coffee when they meet (in your coffeemaker). The more eugenol the water hangs on to, for example, the woodsier the taste of your coffee will be.</p>
<p>Magnesium is particularly sticky, meaning water that's high in magnesium will make coffee with a stronger flavor (and higher levels of caffeine). Hard water can also have high levels of bicarbonate, though, which Hendon found could lead to more bitter flavors coming through.  - A Chemist Has Uncovered A Secret To Brewing Delicious Coffee At Home <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/a-chemist-has-uncovered-a-secret-to-delicious-coffee-2014-6#ixzz3Q3ecJSgz"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Business Insider</em></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So depending on flavor preferences you might prefer your hard water at home but dislike it at work or simply prefer soft water altogether. Traditionally hard water is actually sought after for other beverage processes like beer brewing because of some of the abilities described above.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Using the right material from the start</h2>

<p>Personally, I think this definition could use some updating. Crema exists because of the freshness of the coffee, in relation to it's roast. It contains the gasses we find from roasting, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen gasses. You will notice that if you dig up coffee that is months old and brew it as espresso, there will be little crema. Bottoml ine, if you want crema, you need fresh coffee.</p>

<h2>Extraction</h2>

<p>The other factor in producing crema, is correct extraction. If you have a poorly extracted shot of espresso, it will be primarily water, with some seriously over-extracted coffee. An even extraction will produce the highest yield of crema.</p>

18,2,,2015-01-27T21:07:08.867,11,,"<p>In general, it's best to <em>not</em> store ground coffee. If quality really matters, then the real answer is to back up. Try to grind only enough coffee for what you're using immediately to brew with. If you're buying preground coffee, then storage and optimal quality become somewhat trivial.</p>

<p>Once the surface area of the coffee is increased (by grinding it), the majority of the coffee is exposed to air, accelerates the decomposition of the coffee, meaning it likely isn't going to stay fresh for long anyway. Think of it like opening a dry, red wine. Since it's been opened, it's going to turn faster than it being left in the bottle because it's been exposed to atmosphere.</p>

<p>So in short, if flavor and freshness really matter, try not to <em>store</em> ground coffee if at all possible.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>If you really <strong>must</strong> store ground coffee, keep it sealed airtight. The exposure to atmosphere is going to be the strongest catalyst in making your coffee less than fresh.</p>

<p>In the same way that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bicarbonate#Applications"">baking soda</a> absorbs smells, coffee will absorb smells and flavors in your refrigerator. These compounds can be extracted when you brew your coffee and will contribute to undesired flavors.</p>

22,2,,2015-01-27T21:12:35.147,7,,"<p><strong>In general consistency is more important than a specific setting.</strong></p>

<p>The key is that you can actually control both the size of the grind and actually achieve a homogenous grind allowing you to increase the consistency in the coffee when you brew it as you can assertively control the service area being exposed during the brewing process. Since you stated that you have a burr grinder you are off to a great start. There is no defined, agreed upon coarseness of grind for pour over coffee, but I would definitely say that you would want a courser grind than you would for espresso. Experiment to find the sweet spot by making sure you use exactly the same water, coffee bean roast, and number of beans (and thus volume) between different grind settings to find what meets your flavor best. </p>

<p>If you are particularly worried about ""getting it right"" or do not want to do a ton of experimentation an easy and quick way to jump to a grid would simply to go to a coffee shop, buy a bag of whole beans, ask them to grind it and query them for how coarse of a grind is. </p>

23,2,,2015-01-27T21:13:24.420,13,,"<p><strong>Short reason:</strong> Tradition conflicting with modern brewing practices.</p>

<p><strong>Long reason:</strong> This is more a result of an industry-wide legacy when purchasing equipment, where coffee shop owners will pick up mechanically dosed grinders instead of doserless, or electrically metered models because ""that's how it's been done,"" or because the technology simply wasn't  affordable until simple microcontrollers became cheap. </p>

<p><em>Traditionally,</em> you would grind enough coffee to fill the doser, dispensing grounds for brewing as needed and refilling the doser when the level dropped too low.  Dosers exist to allow for predictably size quantities of grounds to be dispensed into the portafilter, and that's basically it.  </p>

<p>This, however, conflicts with the ""Third Wave"" coffee culture, where flavor and texture are paramount.  In this new culture, coffee beans are ground for immediate use, rather than drawing from a bin.  The moment beans are ground, the gasses contained within (gasses that are the reason Crema exist) are allowed every opportunity to escape.  The longer they sit, the less gasses will be left behind by the time they're used to brew.  </p>

<p>So when a Third Wave coffee shop grinds using a doser, the Barista rapid-fires the dosing lever, essentially moving the coffee straight into the portafilter.</p>

<p>A better plan is just to use a direct-dosing grinder where the grounds are metered by time or weight straight into the filter.  Advances in the packaging options for load cell sensors and simple controllers have made this somewhat common in both consumer and commercial equipment.</p>

<p>The oils in roasted coffee degrade as they are exposed to air (oxidization) as well as heat. As with just about any foodstuff moisture accelerates the spoiling process as well. You should store your coffee in completely sealed, insulated, opaque containers. If you have the ability, vacuum pump the air out of the container for ultimate shelf-stability. Even without vacuum storage you can preserve beans for a long time by placing them inside a ziplock bag or coffee bag with a 1-way air seal and pushing as much air out as possible and then following the above method of airtight, dark and cool storage. Following these guidelines should help to ensure the freshness and flavor of the beans for as long as possible. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coffee grounds contain a hodgepodge of volatile and non-volatile components, such as various oils, acids, and other aromatic molecules [2]. Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as “coffee solubles” and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time.</p>
<p>Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee.</p>
<p>On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2].</p>
<p>Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting “dead” or “flat” due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart.</p>
<p>Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesn’t merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that can’t be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that don’t dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile.</p>
<p>To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee “strength” is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - <a href=""https://scienceandfooducla.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/coffee-brewing-chemistry-hot-brew-and-cold-brew/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew.</a></p>

<p>Chris in AK has a great explanation in the comments as to why darker roasts are <em>perceived</em> to have less caffeine</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a common misconception that darker roasts have less caffeine.  Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.</p>

35,2,,2015-01-27T21:50:40.847,9,,"<p>Bitterness comes from over-extracting coffee. Over-extraction is mainly caused by:</p>

<p>1) brewing for too long: In the beginning of the brewing stage acidic flavors are first extracted, followed by sweetness.  And towards the end of the brew, only bitter flavors are extracted.  The trick is to stop the brewing just after all the sweetness is extracted.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction#Extraction_yield"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee extraction</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yields of under 18% are ""under-extracted"", specifically
  ""under-developed"" – desirable components have not been sufficiently
  extracted – and ""unbalanced"", specifically sour, because acids are
  extracted early, while balancing sugars (sweetness) and bitter
  components are extracted later. </p>
  
  <p>Yields of over 22% are ""over-extracted"", specifically bitter, as
  bitter components continue to be extracted after acids and sugars have
  largely completed extraction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2) Grind size being to small: small grind size means larger total surface area of the particles.  Therefore, flavors get extracted more quickly and can lead to over-extraction. </p>

<p>The optimal brew time and grind size vary depending on the method (french press, manual pour, espresso etc..), and you'll need to experiment to get it just right.  The type of coffee bean also matters, but probably to a lesser degree than the above two factors.</p>

46,2,,2015-01-27T22:18:54.370,19,,"<p>There are a lot of factors that contribute to the bitterness of coffee. Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well.</p>

<p>Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process.</p>

<p><strong>Buying Beans:</strong> Robusta vs Arabica</p>

<p>To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta.</p>

<p>In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts.</p>

<p><strong>Water</strong>: Temperature and Chemistry</p>

<p>You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press.</p>

<p>In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water.</p>

<p><strong>Brewing [Extraction]</strong></p>

<p>Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness.</p>

<p>Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee. </p>

<p><strong>SCIENCE</strong></p>

<p>Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless. </p>

<p>Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee.</p>

<p>Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness.</p>

<p>Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee.</p>

  <p>One large apartment plant will only produce enough coffee for a few cups worth each year, and that's after years of growth. They do look good, though. My point was, indoor coffee plants aren't that effective. Outdoors, a good plant will produce around 2-3 lbs. of grean beans per year. They are usually planted about 8'x8' apart, or a near equivalent, so 680 plants per acre, = around 1700 lbs of green coffee per acre per year, under good conditions.</p>

The process is <a href=""http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/11119/cooling-bread-how-long-wait"" rel=""noreferrer"">similar for bread</a>, with some bakers preferring to let some types of bread rest longer than others.</p>

<p>Right now I am actually drinking a cup of coffee made from beans I roasted this morning, because of poor planning. There's nothing wrong with it but I think it will be better in a couple of days. I find the aromatic qualities peak about 24-48 hours after roasting, but that may be because the off-gassing process is literally emitting the most fumes.</p>

<h2>How the flavor changes</h2>

<p>Subjectively, I'd say the smell and taste change like this:</p>

<p>During <strong>early roasting</strong>, there are wood and vegetable smells, like when you put green wood on a fire and it puts out a lot of moisture-filled steam and begins to smoke.</p>

<p>Toward the <strong>end of the roast</strong>, the smell is more from the browning/caramelization/Maillard reaction and smells kind of like burnt toast. Not really much like coffee.</p>

<p>If you grind and drink it <strong>immediately after roasting</strong>, it tastes like generic coffee,  with those toasty flavors foreground. Very simple and straightforward without a lot of nuance.</p>

<p><strong>After 24 hours</strong> the toasted character has diminished and the nuances have developed a lot more. You can really notice the difference between bean origins. There is much more powerful rich ""amazing coffee"" aroma. I find the sheer quantity of aroma very appealing at 24-48 hours.</p>

<p>Some beans continue to change for <strong>several days after roasting</strong>. Recently I had a batch of Indonesian beans that were still developing and becoming more characteristically Indonesian after a week. I liked them more, but someone else might have liked them less.  </p>

<p>And that, when it comes down to it, is what matters. Some people find some varieties more interesting, more palatable or less harsh as they age. But <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>de gustibus non est disputandum</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's amazing the human nose and tongue can sense these differences.</p>

I've seen many badly designed drip brewers that leave a chunk of dry grounds in the basket when done.

<p>If you drink exotic beans, such as <a href=""http://www.botecentral.net/coffee-alamid-the-worlds-rarest-brew/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alamid</a>, then you <em>probably</em> want to also purchase a hand (crank) powered burr grinder as some beans are particularly sensitive to the heat that can be produced by the grinding process itself.

<p>Longer roasting removes some of the caffeine from the bean, so a lighter roast would be preferred. Additionally you should chose Robusta beans, since their inherent caffeine content is higher than that of arabica beans.</p>

<p>The next step is the grinding. The smaller you grind, the easier it is to extract ""material"" from the ground. This is due to the additional surface area you expose.</p>

<p>Then the last step is the extraction. The longer you expose the ground to water, the more substances you absorb. The extraction roughly has three steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extraction of Acidity</li>
<li>Extraction of Sweetness</li>
<li>Extraction of Bitterness</li>
</ol>

<p>Usually you try to stop extraction after the second step, to have the coffee taste nicely. By that point in time most of the caffeine is already extracted.</p>

138,2,,2015-01-28T13:34:08.870,15,,"<h2>Basics</h2>
<p><strong>Decaffeination</strong> (<em>decaf</em>) is the removal of <strong>caffeine</strong> from coffee beans, cocoa,  and other caffeine-containing materials. While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as &quot;decaffeinated&quot;, they are better termed &quot;uncaffeinated&quot; because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1–2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%.</p>
<p>In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components.</p>
<p>Want to know even more?</p>
<h2>Advanced</h2>
<p>Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination:</p>
<h3>Swiss Water process</h3>
<p>The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980.</p>
<p>This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours.</p>
<h3>CO<sub>2</sub> process</h3>
<p>it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents.</p>
<p>The supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO<sub>2</sub> acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO<sub>2</sub> returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO<sub>2</sub> using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO<sub>2</sub> is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.</p>
<p>There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us.</p>

<li>One reason that the taste isn't as good for Robusta is that it has more caffeine compared to Arabica. Which may sound like a positive thing but caffeine carries a bitter taste which makes it an unpleasant drink. In fact the Robusta bean has 2.7% caffeine content, almost double the 1.5% of Arabica.</li>
<li>Arabica contains almost 60% more lipids and almost twice the concentration of sugar than Robusta. This factor also probably has a big impact on why we prefer the taste of Arabica.</li>
<li>From a price perspective, green beans of Robusta is about half the price of Arabica green beans on the commodity market.</li>
<li>Robusta is easier to tend to on the farm, has a higher yield and is less sensitive to insects - the extra caffeine is a chemical defense for the coffee seed as the quantity in the Robusta is toxic to bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit.</p>
<p>Where you’ll find it: Nowadays, it’s not often you’ll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If you’re drinking instant coffee? Well, that’s probably all Robusta… but you probably don’t care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? That’s a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends – specifically Italian style blends. <em>It is said to help improve</em> the <strong>crema</strong>.
One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, it’s not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isn’t widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Robusta beans are much more circular, whereas Arabica are more oval.</li>
<li>Chlorogenic acid is a significant antioxidant and an insect deterrent. Robusta is 7-10% CGA and Arabica has 5.5-8% CGA.</li>

In The Philippines, we often call this 'Kopi <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_palm_civet"">Alamid</a>', and it truly is one of the rarest coffees on the planet. At around $20 per 75 grams (local price), it's also one of the world's most expensive coffees. </p>

<p>The palm civet is a nocturnal cat (well, more like a ferret, but technically a cat) that eats the berries (beans) and is <em>extremely</em> picky in its diet. For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be <em>just right</em> when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creature's nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect. Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;)</p>

<p>The thing is, the cat doesn't digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp. Farmers follow them around and wait for nature to take its course, then the beans are processed in a very safe manner. Farmers typically get just a kilo or so a day, it's quite an intensive process.</p>

<p>I drink it as often as I can afford to do so, and I have never gotten sick. It's a partly fruity, partly nutty and just an all over <em>cozy</em> and relaxing taste that I highly recommend if you're able to get the coffee. Just be prepared to pay quite a bit, and ready to consume it quickly after getting it home (it does not keep as well as others, probably due to local transportation issues prolonging the time it takes from roasting to actually get to market).</p>

<p>If you have a hand-powered burr grinder, I recommend using it and grinding pretty gingerly, even the heat of most ceramic grinders is enough to lose a little bit of the fruity taste you'd otherwise get. Really, treat these beans like royalty, they're that good.</p>

<p>If you buy some, try to avoid buying from farms with captive civets - the growing popularity of this coffee has led to a cottage trapping industry, which is (unfortunately) likely to seriously endanger them soon.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is to grind just enough to fill the portafilter so the beveled edge of the tamper becomes flush with the edge of the portafilter using about 15kg of pressure.</p>

<p>But how much coffee that is, and just how much over 15kg you need to apply in order to tamp that much coffee to get the right pressure to pull a great shot is a matter of science that you'll need to do. You might want a finer grind instead of more pressure, you have to experiment.</p>

<p>Start with your usual espresso grind setting, a dose appropriate for the size of the filter you're using and then work from there.</p>

<p>You can get grinders that auto tamp for you based on your settings, so when you hit that 'eureka!' moment, you can reproduce it somewhat reliably <em>using the same equipment</em>. For home use? Just be ready to experiment with the first few filters full when you get beans you haven't tried before.</p>

<p>There's no real 'rule' here, other than you want as much coffee as you can get in the filter with the tamper sinking flush given about 15kg-ish of pressure. It varies wildly from there.</p>

<li><p>Coffee enthusiasts &amp; aficionados identify acidity as the dry, bright &amp; sparkling sensation that sets a high-quality, high-grown coffee apart from a mundane, lower-grown coffee. Admittedly, this is the rather snooty way of looking at the issue, though it is true that many highly-prized coffees are grown at high elevation &amp; are characterized by their bright, nuanced qualities.</p></li>
<li><p>On the scientific side, acidity is something to be measured on the pH scale, which uses 7.0 as an indicator of neutrality, numbers under 7 as more acidic &amp; numbers above 7 as lower-acid (or basic). Lemon juice registers at about 2.0; milk at 6.5. A typical higher-acid breakfast blend coffee might land somewhere around 4.7. (Note that ""black coffee"" is marked on the scale below as a 5; this is an average &amp; certainly not universal.)    </p></li>
<li><p>The amount of chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a natural chemical compound which is the ester of caffeic acid and (-)-quinic acid can also determine acidity.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first one is definitely opinion based, the second one differs from blend to blend, from area to area. Because the acidity of the bean is directly proportional to the pH of the soil where the blend is grown. 
The third one divides your choice into two categories, <em>Robusta</em> and <em>Arabica</em>, with Arabica having a lower CGA.
My choice for a optimal coffee would be the <em>Arabica</em> variety somewhere from south-west South America, Middle East, eastern Europe or west Asia.</p>

After roasting, they continue to be affected by environmental factors, their own natural instability, and interaction with other compounds. The most important of these processes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dissipation into other media. Aromatics evaporate from the surface of the coffee into the atmosphere or are dissolved into solvents, where they often interact with other chemicals.</li>
<li>Non-enzymatic browning reactions. These involve carbohydrates, usually sugars, in carmelization and Maillard reactions. Carmelization occurs when a sugar gives up water and carbon dioxide, changing the structure of the sugar and its taste. The Maillard reaction is the result of an interaction between amino acids and carbohydrates in which an aromatically perceived substance is formed. When the Maillard reaction takes place at a high temperature (as in coffee roasting), the result is usually desirable roasted flavors and aromas, but when it takes place at a lower temperature, the result is flat, gluey, and cardboard-like flavors.</li>
<li>Oxidation. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different compounds. In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived) compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.</li>
</ul>

<p>The engine that drives all of these processes forward is thermal energy (heat). This energy can be in the immediate environment, a result of other chemical reactions, or already present in the product.</p>

<p>According to a high-rep legit subreddit AskScience user,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike all of the other posters in this thread, I have done this experiment. A cup of brewed coffee left at room temperature for 24 hours had about 60% of its caffeine remaining. There's been lots of talk of caffeine's chemical stability, but it's a carbon and nitrogen source for bacteria.
  Edit: also, coffee left at 4 degrees celsius for 2 weeks had less than 5% of its original caffeine content.
  The method of assaying caffeine was capillary electrophoresis, a pretty reliable method.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The proteins chains in milk are polar: one end of the chain is
hydrophilic (attracted to water), and the other is hydrophobic
(repelled by water). Because milk is mostly made up of water, as soon
as those proteins unfold, exposing their ends, the hydrophobic ends
immediately try to get as far away from that water as possible. If you
were to look at a single tiny bubble in a cup of foamed milk, you'd
see that the hydrophobic ends of the milk proteins are all pointed
inwards, towards the water-free interior of the bubble, while the
hydrophilic ends stay put in the aqueous environment the bubbles are
suspended in.</p>
<p>This structure helps keep the air bubbles intact for a long time after the steaming &gt; process, all the way into your cup (and into your happy, soon-to-be caffeinated mouth).</p>

  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it won’t actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink.</p>

<p>Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool – but not in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans you’ve ground yourself.</p>

<p>When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Don’t know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that.</p>

<p>No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad. Just remember this rule of thumb: about two weeks after roast the coffee will start decaying.</p>

<p>This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't.</p>
<h2>The Equipment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aeropress</li>
<li>Scoop that came with the Aeropress</li>
<li><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00A1GVVMY"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ultra fine mesh filter</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Coffee</h2>
<p>The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.)</p>
<p>I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00GK5R8IG"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee</a>, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/01/worst-and-best-coffee-at-trader-joes-which-coffee-to-buy-tj.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">it's the best bet</a> for Trader Joe's coffee.)</p>
<h2>The Water</h2>
<p>Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water.</p>
<h2>The Method</h2>
<p>I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up the Aeropress for <a href=""http://ineedcoffee.com/upside-aeropress-coffee-brewing-tutorial/"" rel=""noreferrer"">inverted brewing</a>.</li>
<li>For one shot, use a generous scoop of ground coffee. Tap the assembly on the counter so the mound of coffee flattens out.</li>
<li>Slowly add your just-off-the-boil water. (I use a <a href=""http://districtbean.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hario-Buono-Kettle.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">gooseneck kettle</a> for easy, controlled pouring.) Rotate the Aeropress as you pour and do so until you can no longer see any dry grounds. (The chamber should be about 2/3 full when this is complete.)</li>
<li>Stir slowly until you get that lovely uniform light brown color on the top of the mixture. I use the handle of the scoop for stirring.</li>
<li>Place the cap and filter on top of the assembly and wait 15-60 seconds. (My own brewing time varies wildly, depending on what distracts me during that time.)</li>
<li>Press. With this fine grind and filter, you'll have to press a little harder than with the coarser grind. As you press you'll see foamy buildup gather on top of the grounds. You'll have to press extra hard at the end to squeeze all of that through, but it will drip down onto your shot at the end and form that delightful crema.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Edit:</h3>
<p>As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things:</p>
<ul>
<li>My results vary significantly. I <em>think</em> the contributing factors are the grind and how hard I press at the end.</li>
<li>I never use soap on my Aeropress equipment. I rinse it with tap water after each use, but never run it through the dishwasher. There may be buildup of coffee oils on the surfaces that helps (or hinders??) the foam making process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Edit Redux:</h3>
<p>For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress/165#comment772_165"">mentioned below</a>, all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.)</p>
<p>This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and <a href=""http://aeropresstimer.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">an app full of AeroPress recipes</a>; thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots.</p>
<h3>Edit The Third:</h3>
<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/stackoverflow.com/spreadsheets/d/1tKJx-io7Zk71vrcn0SBcCHRxw2ui5UGpmDaPtViXXec/edit#gid=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">The results are in</a>: I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of <strong>freshly ground beans</strong> and <strong>the mesh metal filter</strong> is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup.</p>
<p>However, the plot thickens. My <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/137/robert-cartaino"">colleague Robert</a> asserts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did &lt; jitter &gt;).</p>
<p>...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it would seem that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshly, very finely ground coffee + paper filter + not much water = crema city</li>
<li>Coffee ground fine in the store + metal filter + water = crema town</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these.</p>

<p>Whole bean coffee will go stale within 14 days - on average. The graph below shows the quick 1.5 standard deviation drop in quality within the first 14 days (marked in red). <sub>*See note below for details</sub></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Zu5y.png"" alt=""Degradation of Perceived Quality Over Time""></p>

<p>Staling in the context of coffee has a commonly agreed on definition - the loss of volatile aromatic compounds and the oxidation of surface oils on the roasted coffee beans. The loss of aromatics affects the flavor profile because: 1) they are both part of the same degradation process and 2) the majority of what you taste in coffee is flavors from volatile aromatics through retronasal olfactory sensation.</p>

<p>This graph was created using data from <a href=""https://gastrograph.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Analytical Flavor Systems</a> where we build quality control and flavor profiling tools for craft beverage producers. <em>Perceived Quality</em> is a non-hedonic assessment of a product's quality. This time series is taken from a degradation study.  </p>

<p>Ground coffee, on the other hand, will stale within minutes. 70 cc of ambient air is enough to render one pound of coffee stale. On average, this process takes seven minutes. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the degradation curve looks about the same! </p>

<hr>

<h1>Data Analysis Minutia (notes)</h1>

<p>This time series model was segmented using daily <em>Perceived Quality</em> means from a random selection of 15,000 coffee reviews. All coffees included are whole bean, freshly ground, third wave coffee brewed in a Chemex with a bleached filter. </p>

<p>Certain other brewing methods, particularly methods optimized for older coffee such a Nel, may show a different degradation curve. </p>

<p>The <em>staling point</em> was selected by a parametric statistical change point analysis, which searches for shifts in the mean and variance of a time series. This time series was modeled for change point analysis using a Poisson distribution as  we're searching for the average number of coffees that go stale within a specific time-point, and the model was set to find <em>at most one change</em>.</p>

<li>How much time is lapsing between pulls of espresso? </li>

<p>The portafilter should be rinsed with the espresso machines line water after every pull. This has the effect of removing the majority of remnant oils and grounds, pre-heating the portafilter, and removing potentially colder temperature water from the head of the line. </p>

<p>If you are pulling shots of espresso with less than 3 minutes between pulls, than the above process is enough, as there isn't enough time for the minute amount of remaining coffee oil to oxidize and become rancid at a tasteable threshold. If there is longer than 3 minutes between pulls, the portafilter should be thoroughly cleaned. </p>

<p>Likewise, if you are pulling different espressos (for example, a standard blend and a single origin), you should thoroughly clean the portafilter between pulls. </p>

<p>I will use a lot of graphs, because a picture is worth a thousand words but a graph can communicate a concept, to dispel a lot of the myths about acidity in coffee. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Roast level is the Primary determinant of sour and acidity in coffee, where lighter roast has more natural acid compounds left unbroken from maillard reaction and strecker degradation (non-enzymatic browning).  This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences by Region</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FChz.png"" alt=""Sour &amp; Acidity in coffee by Country""></p>

<p>Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown! </p>

<p>Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent! </p>

<hr>

<h2>Green Processing</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UE9Xa.png"" alt=""Distribution of Sour and Acidity by Green Processing""></p>

<p>This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour &amp; Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant. </p>

<p>Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Age of the Coffee</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gn6eJ.png"" alt=""Acid Degradation over Time""></p>

<p>If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful. </p>

<p>This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Level of Roast</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uajzo.png"" alt=""Acidity VS Level of Roast""></p>

<p>This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit. </p>

<p>You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered ""French"" or ""Italian"" or even ""Spanish"" roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, <strike>and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.</strike> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the
  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still
  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely don’t
  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. 
  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad
  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and
  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature
  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known
  or suspected carcinogens.</p>

<h2>Cupping</h2>

<p>The preferred method of tasting coffee. This requires only a cupping bowl and spoon. Dose out coffee, pour in the hot water evenly, and at 4 minutes skim off the top to remove the crust while carefully not disturbing what has settled at the bottom. Wait about 12-14 minutes for the coffee to cool to a desirable drinking temperature, and slurp the coffee with the spoon.</p>

<h2>Types of flavors</h2>

<p>There's a variety of descriptions you can use to describe the coffee. Try describe everything. The mouth feel: is it full bodied or light? The acidity: Is it citric or stone fruit? The Smell: What are the aromatics?</p>

<h2>Note keeping</h2>

<p>Every time you taste coffee, keep notes of what flavors you taste. Basic notes of chocolate or smoke are fine, more nuanced flavors like cherry or plum may come out. Don't be afraid to write exactly what comes to mind. If the coffee tastes like captain crunch then write it!</p>

<h2>Comparing coffee</h2>

<p>Don't just taste your coffee by itself. Compare it to other roasts you've done. Compare it to coffees from other cafes as well. Note the differences.</p>

<p>My company builds flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry, using machine learning, data science, and analytical chemistry - let's use some of our 20,000+ coffee reviews to answer this question with <strong>data</strong>.</p>

<p>It has been claimed for some time that cold brew as a method of extracting coffee only exists to minimize the amount of acidity in the flavor profile. This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume! </p>

<p>So what is the full story? Read on! </p>

<hr>

<h2>Acidity in Cold Brewed vs Hot Brewed Coffee</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVwmT.png"" alt=""Sour &amp; Acidity in Cold Vs Hot Brewed Coffee""></p>

<p>These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour &amp; acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average <em>more</em> acidic than its cold brewed counter part. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences in Average Flavor Profile</h2>

<p>But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew? </p>

<p>No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature. </p>

<p>For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).  </p>

<p>Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below: </p>

<p><strong>Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BHdhv.png"" alt=""Average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee"">
This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee. </p>

<p><strong>Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee</strong>
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdOob.png"" alt=""Average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee"">
This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee. </p>

<p>As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and 
acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Differences in Flavor Profile by Brewing Method</h2>

<p>Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types: </p>

<p>(<strong>Reminder:</strong> Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is <em>not</em> Cold Brew coffee.) </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Full Immersion Cold Brew</p>

<ul>
<li>Fresh </li>
<li>CO2 Draft</li>
<li>Nitrogen Draft </li>
<li>Bottled </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ice Drip </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above:</p>

<p><strong>Stumptown Draft Cold Brew</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyNjr.png"" alt=""Cold Brew Draft"">
 This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2. </p>

<p><strong>Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew</strong> </p>

<p>This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PR6CJ.png"" alt=""Nitro Cold Brew""></p>

<p>The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg! </p>

<h3>Update: Very Short Chemical Analysis</h3>

<p><strong>How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee?</strong></p>

<p>It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid). </p>

<p>Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response.</p>

<p>Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time). </p>

The 16-ounce (473-ml) cups of coffee samples contained caffeine in the range of 8.6 mg to 13.9 mg. In another study of popular brands of decaf coffees, the caffeine content varied from 3 mg to 32 mg.

If you were to take a pot of brewed coffee, and boil it, removing the solvent (water) you will likely reach a point as to where the solution is supersaturated, followed by precipitation of a crude extract.</p>

<p>Now is coffee an emulsion? I have heard that typical brewed coffee contains oils from the bean (likely oils that can be seen on darker roasts). If this is the case, then we could say that coffee is both a solution <em>and</em> an emulsion!</p>

215,2,,2015-01-29T09:29:37.567,14,,"<p>There are several ways to roast your own coffee at home on low budget:</p>
<h1>Pan</h1>
<p>This is one of the extremely minimalistic ways to roast coffee, but the degree of complexity is very high as the coffee beans need constant attention due to the nature of the heat that arrises only from one side.</p>
<h1>Oven</h1>
<p>This is likely one of the most common ways to roast coffee at home and a significant step up from the pan, hence the heat is more homogenous. You are still required to mix the coffee now and then hence the plate usually becomes hotter than the upper part of the coffee beans while in the oven.</p>
<h1>Popcorn machine</h1>
<p>This is likely the best method to use at home, but also very messy as the chaff is likely to twirl around while the coffee is being roasted. A method for catching the chaff could be a simple filter that can tolerate heat or a oversized strainer.</p>
<h1>Roasting tips</h1>
<ul>
<li>Never leave the coffee while roasting, the process can escalate very quickly and turn your beans into coal</li>
<li>Cool down your beans quickly after the roasting process, do not leave it on the heat source</li>
<li>Coffee generates chaff which has to be disposed, this is usually a pain when roasting in the oven and pan.</li>
<li>Use a thermometer so you can log the roasting time and duration for analysis.</li>
<li>Roasting can generate a lot of smoke so either roast outside, near a window or use ventilation.</li>

You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences. Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds. The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. </p>

<p>To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired.

Keeping coffee on heat after brewing ""cooks"" it down, just as keeping a soup or sauce on a simmer reduces it. However, it has the opposite effect on coffee than on sauces or soups; instead of making it richer, it destroys the more delicate flavor compounds and makes it taste burnt.

<p>First thing you'll want to consider is the quality of the coffee itself.  Typically, the more expensive a coffee is, the higher quality it will be.  It's the age old phrase, 'You get what you pay for"".</p>

<p>Secondly, the less steps from it being picked to it being in your cup, the better.  Packaged, ground coffee has more steps (Packaging, grinding) before being brewed.  Whole bean coffee has less.</p>

<p>Third, the longer it's been ground, the longer it has had to degrade.  You'll want to grind your whole-bean coffee as close to the time of brew as possible.  Oxygen will erode the flavor of the coffee over time.  Ground coffee has more surface area to be exposed to oxygen.</p>

239,2,,2015-01-29T20:07:08.770,3,,"<p>Coffee is at it's heart and agricultural product and suffers from some of the same issues apples do plus some additional ones stemming from it's need to be roasted/stored/ground and brewed before use.</p>

<p>Different strains of arabica beans will produce varied tasting quality similar to the types of apples.  However, even the highest quality plants still need to be tended to and grown in the right environment.  So farming methods and location play a part.  </p>

<p>After a coffee cherry is grown and picked, it must be processed to get at the bean.  The fruit must be removed somehow and there are various ways to do this, any or all of which can influence the final flavor of the coffee.</p>

<p>Those beans are then often sorted to create homogenous lots of coffee beans, some folks will claim that this sorting can influence final outcome as well.  Assuming the green beans are properly stored and shipped, they arrive finally at a roaster.  </p>

<p>A roaster has potentially the most influence on the final outcome.  They may blend different lots of beans base on a want for a particular flavor profile (or to save money).  And they decide what roast either fits their business model or is best for the beans.  The very same batch of beans will produce drastically different cups of coffee (or espresso) based on the roast level.  Then there is storage of roasted beans.  Some companies grind their coffee before sale, which increases the rate (drastically) at which coffee stales.  Others sell the beans whole.  These will stale too and the rate depends on storage time and method.  </p>

<p>Finally there is the actual method of brewing.  There is a myriad of methods, with some new ones even invented in the last decade.  Any of which can drastically alter the taste of the final product cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Coffee is such a large industry that there are studies and information out there on each step of the process assuming all other variables the same.  One could literally write a book with multiple chapters covering each step of the process.  You still wouldn't be able to come up with any definitive answers because the final step is someone's taste buds and we all have different preferences.   </p>

<p>Talking from experience it depends on how hard the water is where you live and you should really do it every month if it is a hard water area.</p>

<p>I also found that I need to remove the fine filter where the coffee is pumped out to remove the gasket seal and clean all of the above, I was lazy and neglected my Gaggia for about 6 months and after a couple years the solenoid pump died.</p>

<p>The less hassle method would be to use bottled soft mineral water. For instance I have started to only use this with my kettle and there is no limescale build up since switching 1 1/2 months ago, whilst before, using Brita filtered water would start to show limescale after a week and I'd need to descale after 3 weeks.</p>

<p>These are the instructions on my descaling solution for a coffee machine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add 100ml of solution to 500ml of water and add to water reservoir,
  turn on and run through the machine. Then run 2 full reservoirs of
  water before using again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember with citric acid you had to pump it through and then leave for 30 minutes and then fully flush a few times.</p>

<p>Here is a youtube video from Gaggia about performing this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ</a></p>

<p>The key thing here is that if you don't do it then limescale starts to form on the metal filter and gasket seals which will affect the flow rate. This isn't the worst bit though, like with any heating system that uses hard water, the hard limescale will inhibit the heating and pumping performance which can lead to a complete pump failure which is what happened to my machine, I recommend using citric acid (which is a weak acid and safe to consume in diluted form) and/or bottled mineral water.</p>

<p>Personally- I'd skip the stovetop roasting and the oven roasting.

<p>A hot air popper is a really good place to start. I had a hard time getting consistent roasts (and didn't want to get into modding right away), but the quality was so much better than anything I could do in/on the stove. You can get one on Amazon for ~$25... </p>

<p>For example, I make vanilla coffee by mixing fresh vanilla seeds with finely ground medium-roast coffee, and seal the mixture for some time (duration depends on the weather). The result is quite nice, with a slight touch of vanilla. This is <em>not</em> a product---just for personal use and still exploring. The difference with syrup or essence or flavouring is that the touch feels lighter and more natural.</p>

<hr>

<p>A basic mechanism here is to mix ground coffee with some spice, and let the mixture sleep for flavour to spread.</p>

<p>Another mechanism is to put some spice directly in a container with roasted beans. This seems more appropriate for spices like cinnamon (no need to extract seeds like for vanilla).</p>

<p>I have not tried to mix spices with <em>green</em> beans, as the roasting stage changes a lot of things, but that should be an interesting path.</p>

256,2,,2015-01-30T13:33:58.320,15,,"<p>It depends on the press. I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press). </p>

<p>I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually <em>guaranteed</em> to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress. </p>

<p>Most presses can have some or all of the following issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grinds leak through the screen on the plunger quite easily, even with a good coarse grind</li>
<li>Coffee can fall below serving temp before you plunge it if you're not careful</li>
<li>They are a bit of a pain to clean, most can't go <em>near</em> a dishwasher</li>
<li>They tend to be rather fragile</li>
<li>They can stain with certain kinds of water, depending on the glass used</li>
<li>Some argue that the taste of a coarse grind is inferior to finer grinds (a matter of taste is difficult to document)</li>
</ul>

<p>The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste.</p>

<p>I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect <em>of</em> needing to clean it would slow down my consumption. Didn't work.  I love the consistently-good brews I get out of mine, and I love that it keeps my second cup hot long enough for me to enjoy the first.</p>

<p>Some people <em>do</em> mind the quirks, and prefer not to use them. Something decent usually starts at around $40, so they're not prohibitively expensive for experimentation. All I can say is try both and see what you think.</p>

<p>It takes considerably longer and requires more work. A drip filter requires that you grind and put in the coffee; add water to the required level and press start.</p>

<p>A French Press requires that you wait for the water to boil; grind the coffee just right - not too fine, not too coarse; pour in the water; stir; wait 4 minutes for the coffee to steep; stir again; plunge AND then pour.</p>

<p>Re diluting the taste. NO. Not if done correctly. (Which will take a few brews the first time through.)</p>

Coffee is grown in the tropics/sub tropics, and time of year has much less effect on us then it does in temperate zones.  I pick coffee all year round, with great flavor, although twice per year the output shoots up, locally we call this harvest time.</p>

<p>The important point here is not time of year, but maturation time for each bean.  When I pick coffee there are ripe red beans, maturing beans, green beans and flowers on my plants.  Said a different way, there are beans at different stages of production.  To be picked 'at the right time'  means waiting for each bean to be big and red and ripe, and not pick it before, or long after that point.  This is what really matters for the quality.</p>

You can find this amount by calculating exactly how much coffee you initially put into the coffee maker, minus the amount of coffee that was produced. This amount will be very small, but it will affect the mass of the final pulp. Measure out an equivalent amount of water (which is usually measured by volume rather than weight) and weight it on your scale, being sure to subtract the weight of the container from your final measurement.

<p>I have experimented at length with this, and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/137/does-pre-heating-a-puck-on-the-group-head-produce-more-crema"">can detect positively no difference between a shot extracted from a cold filter, and one extracted from a warmed one</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>The first capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme
conditions of space is here. It is called ISSpresso and is the
brainchild of two Italian companies — Argotec and Lavazza — in
collaboration with the Italian Space Agency</p>
<p>Turin, 13 June 2014 – “An espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard
the International Space Station.” We have repeatedly heard this
comment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at
times working in the International Space Station, and today their
espresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza
are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually
bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space
Station. So in the Futura Mission — the second long-term mission of
the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station — another Italian
astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha
Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into
space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic
Italian espresso in orbit.</p>
<p><strong>Its name is ISSpresso.</strong> It takes its name from the International Space
Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first
capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions
of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of
liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.
ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian
engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and
European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for
in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.
ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to
deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it
was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in
the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the
Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects
and activities to be carried out in the ISS.</p>
<p>“Italian coffee is a beverage without borders — comments <strong>Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President
of Lavazza</strong> — and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into
space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched
the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by
Thierry Le Gouès and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the
time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually
just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to
overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso — the
indisputable symbol of made in Italy products — on board the
International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major
project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our
division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific
and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and
nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.”</p>
<p>“Our aerospace engineers — stated <strong>David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec</strong>
— have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the
astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also
thanks to Lavazza’s experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2
systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:
Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra
high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable
with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological
challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the
Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.
In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of
the European astronauts’ training and nutrition. Food provides an
important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian
espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed
especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to
home.”</p>
<p><strong>Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:</strong>
“ISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS
national usage rights available to public-private partnership
initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for
technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring
ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements
with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of
improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the
astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary
exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to
contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the
Made-in-Italy brand at international or better “space”, level.”</p>
<p><strong>A coffee break in space.</strong> A prototype of the space coffee machine is
currently being tested at Argotec’s laboratories and all the necessary
functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica –
Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at
launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of
whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The ‘corner
café’ on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,
a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,
chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in
missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a
very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also
be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffè lungo
or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can
also be rehydrated.</p>
<p><strong>Extra-terrestrial technology.</strong> Every tiniest detail
of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering
challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of
physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of
handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space
environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water
inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special
steel tube <strong>designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar.</strong> The
machine is so complex that it weighs <strong>about 20 kilograms since there
are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in
accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space
Agency.</strong> ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project
which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronauts’
menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid
dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted
have led to international patents, which will be useful both for
future space missions and immediate terrestrial use...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food.</p>

<p>No. (Unless you're in a really bad diner in which case you shouldn't be ordering lattes there.)</p>

<p>There are several differences between a latte and a cappuccino.</p>

<p>One is the ratio of milk to espresso. A cappuccino is 1-1 milk to espresso and the latte is 2-1 milk to espresso. </p>

<p>Another difference is that the milk is treated differently. In a latte the milk is heated as opposed to being frothed. In a cappuccino the milk is frothed (converted into a microfoam) to about double it's original volume. (If you've ever heated or foamed milk you'll have noticed how the milk changes state as it's being heated.) </p>

<p>Finally the way the milk and espresso are combined is different. In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top. In a cappuccino the frothed microfoam is poured over the espresso.</p>

<p>Your specific example of brewing with a french press will also have trouble being determined because we don't know your grind size (exposed surface area), and we don't know your dose. Caffeine yield is directly related to dose.</p>

<p>In a standard cup of coffee, there is approximately 150 mg of caffeine. In a cup of black tea, steeped for 3 - 5 minutes there is approximately 50 mg of caffeine. In a double espresso there is approximately 60 - 90 mg of caffeine depending on the roast, grind, extraction time, etc.</p>

<p>In one dark roasted espresso bean there is approximately 6 mg of caffeine according to <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/coffee-beans"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this source.</a></p>

<p>If a person is <strong>extremely sensitive</strong> to caffeine, they would probably be able to feel the effect of 6 mg of caffeine. However, if someone is a coffee drinker, the likelihood that this caffeine is actually affecting them is <strong>very</strong> unlikely.</p>

<p>If your friend never ingests soda, coffee, tea, or caffeine in any form then he <strong>may</strong> have felt some of the effects. In my opinion, the majority of the way your colleague was feeling was probably a placebo effect.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Coming back to this answer, I neglected to mention the effect of the taste of the coffee bean. Taste and aroma can powerfully affect and stimulate the brain. Due to the relatively strong taste resulting from chewing up a roasted coffee bean, this may have also contributed to the reported feeling of stimulation.</p>

<p>While the coffee stays hot the caffeine level will decrease. The speed will depend on the temperature and the amount of caffeine to start with (which is thoroughly discussed in other questions here).</p>

<p>When the coffee cools bacteria growth will start. At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth. Some people's guts will handle that bacteria without a problem, other people may get sick.</p>

<p>Edit: I should point out that as I have researched more I'm less certain about the statement regarding caffeine levels over time. Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear. Some suggest that bacteria eats the caffeine, which does tie into why it becomes less safe to drink over time.</p>

312,2,,2015-02-03T15:23:36.390,4,,"<p>It all boils down to three questions:
1) Yield = How much did you get from the grounds?
2) Strength = How much ended up in the cup?
3) Ratio = What did you get there?</p>

<p>Yield: Yield pertains to how much soluble you took from the coffee grounds. Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually you’d get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and you’ve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and you’re not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, “How much did you get from the grounds?”</p>

<p>Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit more… something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and you’re in the “heavy, thick” coffee zone. Simply put,“How much ended up in the cup?”</p>

<p>Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, “How did you get there?” Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when they’re finding that they’re using 80 grams or more per liter when they’re making coffee. Is it “wrong” to make coffee at 90 g/L? No… but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L?</p>

<li>used grounds are fairly pH neutral. If your compost is too acidic they even help a little by absorbing extra acid. Unused grounds however would add to acidity.</li>
<li>coffee grounds are considered ""green material"" in compost lingo which is usually what compost piles need more of, as opposed to brown material that is fairly abundant in average land plots (maybe not for apartment composters).</li>
<li>coffee grounds attract worms, so even if some bacteria are harmed the worms are compost rock-stars and they make up for it</li>

<p>A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile.

  <p>The subtropical regions, at high altitudes of 16-24° (Illy, 21). 
  Rainy and dry seasons must be well defined, and altitude must be
  between 1800-3600 feet.  These conditions result in one coffee growing
  season and one maturation season, usually in the coldest part of
  autumn.  Mexico, Jamaica, the S. Paulo and Minas Gerais regions in
  Brazil, and Zimbabwe are examples of areas with these climate
  conditions (Illy, 21).</p>
  
  <p>The equatorial regions at latitudes lower than 10° and altitudes of
  3600-6300 feet (Illy, 21).  Frequent rainfall causes almost continuous
  flowering, which results in two coffee harvesting seasons.  The period
  of highest rainfall determines the main harvesting period, while the
  period of least rainfall determines the second harvest season. Because
  rainfall is too frequent for patio drying to occur,  artificial drying
  with mechanical dryers is performed in this type of coffee growing
  environment. Examples of countries that have this climate are Kenya,
  Colombia, and Ethiopia (Illy, 21).</p>

324,2,,2015-02-03T23:08:21.193,38,,"<p>I read everyone's answer and did some of my own research to find an estimation method that satisfies me and might be helpful to others too. I think it should be roughly ±20% accurate.</p>

<h1>For any amount of ""good strength"" American-style coffee by any brew method, weigh the dry coffee in grams and multiply by 0.008, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.</h1>

<p>Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine. </p>

<p>These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine.</p>

<p>Explanation below:</p>

<h2>Maximum caffeine content</h2>

<p>Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain <a href=""http://www.academia.edu/6246212/Analytical_Methods_Measurement_of_caffeine_in_coffee_beans_with_UV_vis_spectrometer"" rel=""noreferrer"">close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)</a>
though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"" rel=""noreferrer"">roughly twice that
much</a>. </p>

<p>If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: <strong>each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine.</strong></p>

<p>I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of
beans weighs about <strong>12 grams</strong> (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh
once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight
and volume).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NwqDW.jpg"" alt=""2Tbsp scoop of beans weighing 12g""></p>

<p>So if I <em>eat</em> that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them
with any amount of water I will be consuming the <strong>120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine</strong>
present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation
exercise. <em>The strongest <strong>or</strong> biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with
that scoop of beans will have <strong>no more than</strong> 120mg caffeine</em>. </p>

<h2>How strong is my cup?</h2>

<p>Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in 
<a href=""http://www.mountaincity.com/brewing-1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%
considered optimal</a> whereas 
<a href=""http://www.coffeechemistry.com/brewing/brewing-fundamentals.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">""a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%""
solids</a></p>

<p>So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water
(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 300-600mg, or 380mg solids for optimal brewed coffee and 600mg solids for espresso). That would be the upper limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be. </p>

<p>On the other hand,the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with <a href=""http://coffeechemistry.com/caffeine/caffeine-content-in-espresso-vs-drip-coffee1.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz</a>. That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of ""optimal"" brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso.</p>

<p>So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of
beans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it ""too weak"" and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength.</p>

<p>I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains <strong>around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee,</strong> or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for ""optimal"" strength American-style brewed coffee is around <strong>0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee.</strong></p>

<h3>Bonus corollary/sanity check</h3>

<p>Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with <a href=""http://www.coffeeforums.com/forum/coffee-drinks/2733-how-much-grounds-used-make-espresso.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">7g of ground
coffee</a> maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the <strong>64mg/shot</strong> reported by <a href=""https://www.google.com/#q=caffeine%20in%20espresso"" rel=""noreferrer"">the USDA and others</a> also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans.</p>

335,2,,2015-02-04T17:19:50.207,5,,"<p>If you think you can get some money but not a lot, I'd start by switching to whole-bean coffee and purchasing both a grinder and air-tight containers to store the coffee in. Even cheap coffee tastes much better when it's fresh and freshly ground. Buy a mid-range grinder and two airtight containers (one for whole beans, and one for grounds). At the start of every day, you can grind enough to get you through the day. Coffee is best when it's used within about 2 weeks of being roasted and ground, though it'll still be drinkable longer than that, especially if stored properly. </p>

<p>The other thing you can do that doesn't cost any money is to experiment with how much coffee you use per pot. I've been in a lot of offices where people assume that more grounds automatically means better coffee, but adding too many grounds can lead to a very unpleasant bitter, metallic, or acidic taste. So try adding slightly less coffee when brewing a fresh pot and see if that helps, even if you don't change anything else.</p>

I can't think of anyone that would flavor the beans before roasting.  Not only would the high heat of the roasting risk degrading the taste of the flavoring oils, it would also affect the roasting process and flavor the roasting equipment.</p>

<p>When you grind the coffee the trapped gases are released and when the hot water hits it, this releases the gases quicker.</p>

<p>Factors aside from storage that can affect this phenomenon are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Temperatures that the beans were stored at.  Hotter means more gas release.</li>
  <li>Humidity levels during storage.  Dryer levels allow more gas to escape.  Of course, high humidity levels may encourage mold and fungus
  growth so you need to find a happy medium.</li>
  <li>Bean hardness.  Harder beans mean more density for the gas to make its way through.</li>
  <li>Roast level.  Roast level will have a large influence on bloom.  Extremely dark, oily, Italian roasts have a much lesser amount of
  out-gassing compared to exact same coffee roasted Full City.</li>
  <li>Origin.  Some coffee origins are known to have more out-gassing than others.</li>

<p>To answer your question, it depends on how you like your coffee.  Grind finer and/or pour slower and you will get a stronger cup of coffee.  Grind courser and pour more quickly and you will get a weaker cup of coffee.  Pouring from the center sometime results in a raised edge around the rim, which isn't ideal when I am trying to fill the cone as full as possible, but in a true pour over, may be fine.  Pouring from the side seems to sometimes result in a small island of dry grounds floating in the middle of the cone.

<p>First, try having decent filtered water delivered, and use that to fill the machine. I know that it sounds trivial, but the quality of water can affect how <em>any</em> coffee tastes. It can render your espresso tart, or turn your Folgers into mud pie soup. This should also result in less build up of 'gunk' in your machine.</p>

<p>Second, eliminate your filters as a cause of bad taste. To do this, heat some water to about 95 degrees Celsius, pour it through a few of the filters and into a container to cool. Wait for it to cool, smell and taste the water. Any after taste or odor? You got it from the filters, change your brand. While it's not <em>always</em> true, the more expensive the filter, the better the chance that it's not going to shed fibers or tastes into your brew.</p>

<p>Third, have your machine cleaned. Ask any diner who does it for them, and take it to wherever that is. Stuff can build up that a simple cleaning can't handle, the machine should be broken down and cleaned thoroughly, especially if you're getting that vegemite-like 'burnt'  taste to things. </p>

<p>Finally, if Maxwell House is the coffee everyone can agree on, try putting a pinch of kosher salt in the basket with the grinds before you brew - it can <em>really</em> help to bring out latent flavors that might still be in the beans (provided that the coffee is still reasonably fresh), it won't make the coffee taste salty. Not much, 10 crystals or less, but try adding a pinch. </p>

<p>I think pound for pound, you'll get the most out of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having the machine professionally cleaned</li>
<li>Having better water delivered, and using that to brew</li>
<li>Tossing a few crystals of kosher salt in with the grinds</li>
</ul>

Additionally size may be used and beans can be sorted with screens (slightly more automated) to produce lots that appear more consistent in size.  While these things may affect appearance, they are not thought to affect taste (by most) and so all of these will likely be sold.  However, during these same processes, any truly ""bad"" beans (moldy, unformed, etc) will probably be removed and discarded.  If buyers see significant amounts of bad beans in a lot, it will be assumed that care was not taken in the processing of the coffee.</p>

<p>I roast at home and the only time I have ever ""sorted"" is if a bean or two from a previous batch was hidden in my drum and gets BBB'd (burnt beyond belief) in a second roasting process.  Depending on roasting process, there is always a range of time that the beans get to certain points, they don't all hit first crack or second crack at the same time.  If the beans are of sufficient quality and properly sorted after processing (at the source/origin) those ranges will be fairly narrow with not a lot of overlap.  The machine I have now does a fairly good job or mixing the beans during roasting and the roasts I get from it are quite consistent.  If I roast at a lower temperature longer, usually even more so.</p>

<p>To answer your question, the higher the quality of green beans and the better the roast technique, the less the need for sorting (if any).  I can hardly see any reason for sorting beans for size/shape after the roasting process.  Roasted coffee should be stored in opaque packaging, and any efforts to unify appearance would be nullified by proper storage.  If there is so much variation in the roast that it needs sorting for flavor, I would suggest that time might be better spent refining the roasting process for consistency.</p>

<p>As when brewing coffee, we're trying to expose the grounds evenly to the hot water, the release of gas fights against this, causing channeling or uneven extraction. This can affect your flavor profile by overextracting some of the coffee, and not extracting enough from the rest.</p>

<p>From my own experience, fresher, better-quality coffees tend to produce more gasses. I would imagine this being because the gasses escape on their own over time from the coffee when it's just sitting around.</p>

<p>All in all, decaffeinated coffee beans have less acid in them than their counterparts, but because the choice beans for decaffeination are already high in acid, this may make most decaf coffees have a higher acidic content in general when compared to other coffees.</p>

381,2,,2015-02-07T01:39:23.133,4,,"<p>As an American, I've never heard of a long black, but it sounds like a great idea. I normally drink brewed coffee black, but I enjoy an occasional Americano. The only problem is that they're generally served around 400,000° and I can barely hold them and have to wait hours for them to cool down enough to drink. Sometimes I ask for ice or something to cool it quickly. If I just wait for it to cool, it tends to taste rather old and stale by the time I can handle it. Or maybe I just can't taste it because my tongue is crispy from preliminary attempts. But the crema and freshness is always long gone.</p>

<p>I think that must secretly be the real reason for a long black—by adding the espresso to the top of drinkable-temperature water, you still have a chance at the best flavors and aromas. As <a href=""http://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/2011/12/19/the-espresso-menu-explained"" rel=""nofollow"">the Australian coffee roasters Five Senses put it,</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regardless of the crema, the long black tastes best as it cools slightly from boiling to a drinkable temperature. Only then will you be able to perceive some of the finer nuances and sweetness of the coffee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I would shoot to <strong>have the cup around the same temperature as good brewed coffee by the time it hits the drinker's lips</strong>. According to <a href=""http://www.coffeedetective.com/what-is-the-correct-temperature-for-serving-coffee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Coffee Detective,</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[American-style brewed] coffee is best served at a temperature between 155ºF and 175ºF (70ºC to 80ºC). Most people prefer it towards the higher end, at about 175ºF.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means, depending on cup type and ambient temperature, if you draw 200°F hot water from the machine before you start making the espresso and leave it uncovered, it will be roughly the right temperature to serve by the time the shots are ready.</p>

<hr>
<p>So there are a <a href=""https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=coffee+alzheimers&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">whole bunch</a> of studies that have been done that have investigated a potential link between coffee consumption and Alzheimers.</p>
<p>The problem, as always, is that these types of '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cohort studies</a>' are really difficult. Basically the way it works is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a load of volunteers</li>
<li>By doing questionnaires, work out everything about them</li>
<li>Track them over a long period of time</li>
<li>See if there's a statistically significant link between combinations of behaviours (such as drinking coffee) and a particular outcome (diagnosis of Alzheimers)</li>
</ul>
<p>All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for <em>causation</em>, only for <em>correlation</em>. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers.</p>
<p>There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption).</p>
<p>Remember also that medical studies are <em>chronically</em> badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed <em>wildly</em>. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline.</p>
<p>One tool against all of this uncertainty is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_analysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meta-analysis</a>. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/174313206X152546"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One of these was done</a> in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results. Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Heterogeneous is science for 'different')</p>

<p>Long answer: </p>

<p>Ignoring things like Kopi Luwak etc, there is a cost associated with growing, harvesting and transporting arabica beans in a timely manner, roasting them while they're fresh, and getting them to somewhere you can buy them.</p>

<p>If you go below this price, corners will be cut. You may get cheaper robusta beans, or a mix. You will get older, staler beans. You will get the poor end of the harvest.</p>

<p>However, go above that price and you're needlessly spending extra cash. You're now spending on marketing for the people you're buying it from. You're paying for a fancier bag, better branding etc. This may actually make it taste bette - <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0148296382900418"">psychology is a powerful thing</a>, but the beans you're getting won't be significantly different.</p>

<p>The problem is, this magic price-point is impossible to find, fluctuates wildly, and it's in the interests of suppliers to obfusticate it as much as possible.</p>

<p>My advice would be to try a variety of coffees that you can afford and find one you like. </p>

390,2,,2015-02-09T16:56:13.817,6,,"<p>Comments on the question above, but I'd expand this as an answer as well because I don't see it mentioned yet.</p>

<p>Another possibility of ""diner coffee taste"" could be due to the use of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robusta_coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">robusta</a> rather than <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arabica</a>. Robusta tends to be cheaper than arabica, so this might also be a reason for its use (and the cited ""cheapness"") of the cup. If you're used to fancy cafe coffee (which tends to be arabica), it's a rather different (albeit not necessarily unpleasant) experience. See also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/116/262"">this question on arabica and robusta</a>.</p>

<p>Granted, this arabica/robusta distinction is oversimplification, because there are so many varietals, but here's <a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/coffee-basics-the-difference-b-41949"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one article</a> on differences. For example, robusta tends to have lower acidity, but higher bitterness. If these are the attributes you attribute, it might be further robusta evidence.</p>

<p>If you were to learn the brand of coffee being brewed, that might suggest the variety of the beans, but that's probably difficult to learn from generic, anonymous diners.</p>

391,2,,2015-02-09T17:23:46.657,3,,"<p>I have found that like almost all purchased products, you generally get what you pay for.  More expensive is usually better, but not always directly in line with the price.  </p>

<p>Things that are stand out more expensive than their contemporaries (Kopi Luwak, many Kona coffees, and currently Gesha varietals) are often very good, but not necessarily as good as their price tag.  I wouldn't say any Kona or Gesha coffee is 4 times better than the South and Central Americans I prefer, but because of real estate and labor prices for Kona, and the current ""rush"" popularity of gesha, they are that much more expensive.  </p>

<p>Many people don't think about the cost of things like getting organic or fair trade certified.  Those things cost money for growers/processors to obtain, and that price is passed on.  If you care very much about such things, however, it may make a lot of sense to pay $1 more a pound for your coffee.  Even though the bag right next to it may be of the exact same quality for less money, it doesn't support your beliefs/ideals/principles.</p>

392,2,,2015-02-09T17:35:23.087,8,,"<p>Yes.  You should remove the lid for maximum effect.  Somewhere around <a href=""http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/C10/C10Links/ericir.syr.edu/Projects/Newton/11/tstesmll.html"">three quarters of our perception of taste comes from smell</a>.  There are varying figures out there, but most are fairly high.  </p>

<p>However, much of that comes from the olfactory sense when the molecules pass from our mouth to our sinuses.  So, having a stuffy nose is more likely to reduce the taste of your coffee than drinking it with the lid on.  That being said, the aroma from brewed coffee tends to dissipate fairly quickly, so you might only need to leave the lid off your cup for the first few minutes of your ""coffee experience"". </p>

I have never heard of warming the coffee itself. I can't imagine that, at the temperature at which the brew head usually resides, many significant changes are made in just a few moments of warming the coffee.</p>

<p>The closest I've heard to this is that some believe in the opposite. A fellow once told me to leave my spent puck in the portafilter if someone was going to be brewing again shortly. He claimed this helped retain heat in the portafilter. Though the science checks out, the results proved marginal and pretty much just made you the lazy guy using the espresso machine.</p>

<p>So, in closing, I'd say that the effects of warming your coffee are probably negligible, and that you can get more crema more easily through other means (buying better quality coffee, adjusting your brewing variables, etc)</p>

Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/262"">this answer</a>). I don't think the grounds are meant to be tamped like espresso, either.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">percolator</a> boils water and drips it over grounds continuously.  There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee.</p>

<p>I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome.</p>

420,2,,2015-02-10T17:01:27.283,3,,"<p>Here comes an unintentionally snarky answer:</p>

<p>Flavored coffee and high quality coffee are rarely synonymous. Since flavored coffee masks the organic and natural flavors of the coffee itself, it's rare that a quality bean is used in the first place.

<p>Ergo, I'd say that your brew temperature with a flavored coffee isn't extremely important. In the end, you're really just going to be tasting artificial (natural if you're <em>lucky</em>) flavors that cover up the taste of the bad coffee underneath.</p>

<p>What I would say, however, is before you start using quality coffee after using flavored coffee, be sure to clean your equipment thoroughly. The flavors used in those coffees have a tendency to stick around long after they're gone.</p>

<p>I use the double shot as the example because it is considered to be the standard.</p>

<p>So essentially, pull a double shot until 60 mL or 2 ounces comes out. You can use something to measure this volume like a graduated shot glass. Time how long this takes. I always aim for 20 seconds. If it is faster than 20 seconds, then you need to make your grind slightly finer. If it is slower than this, then you need to make the grind slightly coarser.</p>

<p>Then modify to your taste! If you like the way it tastes when it takes 30 seconds, then drink away and enjoy. If you prefer 20 seconds, then enjoy that!</p>

<p>I use the ""plunging"" method, mixing grounds directly with water, as described in other answers by @henryJ and @Eric. I find that the outcome of brewing, then filtering via French press, is too gritty or grainy, far more so than the store-bought stuff (which might be slow-drip, but I don't know how it's done on a production scale).</p>

<p>Filtering that result through a conventional coffee filter (e.g., <a href=""http://www.rachaelraymag.com/blogs/rachael-ray/2013/07/25/how-to-make-cold-brew-coffee/"">like this</a>) takes a <em>long</em> time -- on the order of hours for some reasonable quantity of coffee. I don't know exactly why, but I attribute this to the longer brew resulting in more stuff that clogs the paper filter; this clogging seems to happen no matter how coarsely I grind the coffee. (I'd be happy to hear suggestions about that, though; doesn't seem enough for a question...)</p>

<p>I use a multi-step filtering process, putting the coffee through a few passes of cheesecloth or other cloth to hopefully filter out the bigger chunks first, but this is messy (hard to clean up) and seems wasteful. </p>

<p>Here's a few other techniques with similarly absurd steps to filter the coffee during or after brewing.  Both are steeping in the style of a tea bag, with the grounds wrapped in a sack.</p>

<p>Moka pots - They use small amounts of pressurized water flowing through the coffee grind to make a fine stovetop espresso.

<p>On the other hand...</p>

<p>Percolators - These objects that resemble tall, thinner tea pots make cups of coffee with the high heat and lengthy steeping process. Steeping might not really the word here but here is how they do it:
The percolator heats the water from the bottom to create steam. The steam goes up, condenses as water in the top compartment, and then drips through the grounds, making coffee at the bottom of the percolator. The coffee slowly strengthens as the process continues. Flavors may vary...</p>

In my experience in messing with this, <strong>I have not found the order of adding ingredients makes much difference</strong> (i.e., putting coffee into the soya milk). <strong>It absolutely depends on the type of coffee</strong>, also, because <a href=""http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">different coffees will have different degrees of acidity</a>.  See also <a href=""http://www.highlandcoffeesbr.com/coffeeprofileschart.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this table</a> about relative acidity levels.</p>

<p>However, it is certainly the case that <strong>adding coffee into the milk will be helpful in general</strong> (compare also to <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/4208/25286"">tempering of eggs</a> or adding acid <em>into</em> water rather than the other way around).  In this order, these allow temperature and acid (respectively) to more slowly come into balance between the two substances as they are being combined.</p>

<p>IMHO, I have found <em>the brand</em> (i.e., the ingredients and production methods) of the soya milk to be the biggest factor. I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that <strong>soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee</strong>.  My only guesses are that </p>

<ul>
<li>these compounds (emulsifiers, thickeners, or stabilisers, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrageenan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">carrageenan</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">xanthan gum</a>) interfere with the coagulation, or</li>
<li>something else in the processing (perhaps, e.g., pasteurisation) has denatured the proteins or otherwise chemically changed the nutrients such that they are less likely (cf., UHT or ultra-pasteurised milk)</li>
</ul>

<p>I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally.</p>

<p>Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination). There's another question <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/q/45476/25286"">about storing soya milk in the freezer</a>, where we reached similar conclusions.</p>

<p>At the risk of making this an even longer answer, here are some other things to try:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add <em>cold coffee</em> into soya milk.  Does it curdle?  If so, it seems temperature is not your only enemy.</li>
<li>Check your label; does it have carrageenan or so?  If so, this might not be the metaphorical silver bullet.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested (fascinated, even; obsessed, maybe?:) ) with this, so I'd really like to hear feedback. Of the dozens of articles I've read on this, I've still not found a proper solution.</p>

<p>Happy experimenting; comments welcomed.</p>

<p>I got a tea infuser with a very fine mesh and put my grounds in that.

<p>There's no visible particulate in the resulting drink, though if I run the brew through a filter (which is a heckuva lot faster, as there's no clogging of grounds at all!) it comes out with a small amount of lint-like residue.

<p>You could also go for an intermediate approach, using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_strainer"">tea strainer</a> before you run the brew through a regular filter: that'll get the big stuff out fast so your filtering doesn't slow down.

<p>Nel Drip preparation differs (from other pour-over/drip) in its apparatus (""Nel Pot""), which itself consists of a cotton / flannel filter loosely hanging or suspended over a glass carafe. It also seems to be called ""woodneck"" (but this is <em>not</em> the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemex_Coffeemaker"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chemex</a>, which also has a wooden bit). ""Nel"" seems to be stylised as proper noun, but also seems to be short for flan-<strong><em>nel</em></strong>, and is of Japanese origin, though I can't find any proper references.</p>

<p>As with other brewing methods, there seems to be some kind of romantic fascination or magical mystique about it, and perhaps a ""cult-like following"" of sorts. I've seen widely varying comments, from the preparation method being fragile or finicky, to ""easy, cheap ... incredible"" (both from links above).</p>

<p>It looks like Nel Drip preparation takes <em>more gear, more preparation, more grounds, coarser grounds, and more maintenance</em>. There's talk of pre-boiling the filter, bamboo paddles, storing the filter in the fridge or freezer, ...?</p>

438,2,,2015-02-12T00:01:22.117,13,,"<p>The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be <strong>oxidation.</strong></p>

<h2>Oxidation</h2>

<p>Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from <a href=""http://www.blackbearcoffee.com/resources/81"" rel=""noreferrer"">this source.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons
  are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different
  compounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates
  two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)
  compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee.</p>

<p>The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly. </p>

<p>When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'.</p>

<p>The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste.</p>

<h2>Loss of heat</h2>

<p>As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix.</p>

<p>So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day.</p>

<p><strong>Answering your final question about duration of freshness:</strong></p>

<p>How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour.</p>

<p>As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale.</p>

<p>As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. <strong>The sooner you drink it the better.</strong></p>

<h2>What You Can Do</h2>

<p><strong>Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask.</strong> You might also look into cold brewing.</p>

<p>It depends on the beans and roast; your comparison point is the first few (after pre-infusion) drips that came out. The last ones are always going to be weaker and quite possibly more acidic because the puck is both drained and saturated at the same time. It's drained of oils and flavors, and saturated with hot water. </p>

<p>Whether or not you can actually <em>detect</em> that difference should it be added to the rest of the shot is a matter of uncertainty, hinging on your sense of taste and the type of coffee used. If it's a dark-roasted robusta blend then you <em>might</em> be able to detect a slight almost 'metallic' or slightly salty flavor, but you'd need an extremely acute sense of taste. The water you use also has a lot to do with this.</p>

<p>It can sometimes be easy to get caught up in what is <em>probably</em> happening, even if you (or most) can't really taste it. If you get more satisfaction out of your coffee because you've managed to improve the taste <em>even just a tiny bit</em> - then great, and keep doing it, because that's what it's all about. Just be critical and test for yourself, with your setup, and your beans :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warum falte ich Filterpapier vor dem Einlegen um?</strong></p>
<p>Damit die Kaffeezubereitung optimal funktioniert, muss das
Filterpapier genau in die Form des Filters gebracht werden. Dies
geschieht, indem Sie die beiden geprägten Ränder umfalten. Das
Filterpapier schmiegt sich dadurch an den Rand des Filters an und
sitzt tief im Filtereinsatz. Durch diese gute Passform kann sich das
Filterpapier während des Brühvorgangs nicht einklappen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why I fold the coffee filter?</strong></p>
<p>For a good result the coffee filter must be in exactly the form of the
drippter. This is done by folding over the two embossed edges. The
coffee filter is nestled by the edge of the dripper and sits deep in
it. Through these good fit, the coffee filter can not collapse during
the brewing process.</p>

This is because you're diluting the coffee when you add the ice (which melts), even more so if you're trying to start with freshly brewed and very hot coffee (melting more ice).

<p>Fundamentally, a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino#Preparation"" rel=""nofollow"">cappuccino</a> consists of espresso and steamed milk (see distinction from a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte"" rel=""nofollow"">latte</a>). The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Barista_Championship"" rel=""nofollow"">World Barista Championship</a> specifies the proper construction in their <a href=""http://www.worldbaristachampionship.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2015-WBC-FINAL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">beverage definitions (.PDF)</a> in §2.2.2. It consists of a single-shot of espresso (25 mL / ~0.8 fl. oz.), textured (steamed) milk, and <em>at least</em> 1 cm of foam (other places suggest 2 cm). Total volume is 150-180 mL / 5-6 fl. oz.  To the extent that you subscribe to the WBC being a benchmark, the <strong>components</strong>, <strong>volume</strong>, and <strong>amount of foam</strong> define physical properties of a properly made cappuccino. It also states that the components should be in ""harmonious balance.""</p>

<p>The WBC states that aspects of the service are also crucial, such as</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>visual appearance</strong>, such as that the beverage should fill the cup;</li>
<li><strong>served with accoutrements</strong>, such as ""spoon, napkin and unflavoured water"";</li>
<li><strong>logistical aspects</strong> of drinking, such as temperature and holding the cup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that, there's a lot of variability that might lean closer to personal preference. Some other topics mentioned at WBC and Wikipedia include being ""wet"" (referring to the foam, versus ""dry""), and ""traditional"" (solid central circle of white foam, versus having <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latte_art"" rel=""nofollow"">latte art</a>).</p>

<p>Other recipes for cappuccino at home vary greatly:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.folgerscoffee.com/coffee-how-to/how-to-videos/cappuccino"" rel=""nofollow"">Folgers suggests</a> to use equal parts of coffee (French press or drip), steamed milk, and foam. You'll get a rather different outcome from using coffee instead of espresso.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee/how-prepare-cappuccino"" rel=""nofollow"">illy suggests</a> quantities for a more traditional preparation, using espresso and steamed/foamed milk.</li>

The coffee should sit for about 12-16 hours at room temperature. Then plunge, and here is the concentrate.

<blockquote>
  <p>The bottom line is that caffeine is generally safe, but it does have significant effects in children as well as adults. Note that children are much more likely to encounter caffeine in a soft drink than in tea or coffee; that's what you have to worry about, I think, not Starbucks. A cup of green tea contains ~15-25 mg of caffeine, which is around the limit where there were no noteworthy affects for a 50 kg child, so if they want to hang out at a cafe, they don't even have to limit themselves to strictly caffeine-free options</p>

As said in this <a href=""http://kidshealth.org/parent/growth/feeding/child_caffeine.html"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>, USA has not made any guidelines but recommends putting caffeine to a minimum in younger kids. Drinking too much coffee or at the wrong time can harm children in multiple ways. Canadian guidelines though, say that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Canadian guidelines recommend that preschoolers get no more than 45 milligrams of caffeine a day. That's equivalent to the average amount of caffeine found in a single 12-ounce (355-milliliter) can of soda.</p>

<p>Yep, preschoolers might as well be drinking a 12 ounce Cola-Cola every day. Side effects in <strong><em>both</em></strong> kids and adults can be pretty annoying. One way it affects young children maybe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of sleep</p></li>
<li><p>Unable to learn at school properly</p></li>
<li><p>Sleepiness</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Adults... Well you know what some of your side effects are. You can say it can you get you drunk, except you get more active then sleepy. Drinking coffee or high-caffeine drinks are said ""to help with studying"" but in a Houston news study, most college students can barely remember what they learned during their ""caffeine overload"".

<p>Not long ago I discovered something called <strong>Bulletproof Coffee</strong>.  It seems to be associated with the Paleo diet movement.  It involves adding butter to your coffee.</p>

<p>I asked around at a few coffee shops but nobody seems to know why anyone would do this!</p>

<p>Articles such as <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/nov/25/bulletproof-coffee-is-adding-butter-to-your-morning-coffee-a-step-too-far"">this</a> one claim it gives an energy boost.</p>

<p>The point is, it's a change in <em>perception</em>; e.g., the salt is not chemically changing the bitter compounds, just interfering with the bitterness receptors in your tongue. Conversely, the article seems to suggest that the bitterness doesn't reduce the perception of saltiness; this to me suggests that your coffee will taste salty. <em>Caveat emptor!</em> There's a bit more discussion on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Saltiness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">saltiness</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste#Bitterness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bitterness</a> sections of the Wikipedia article on taste.</p>

<p>The idea seems to be to flood yourself with stimulants and concentrated sources of macronutrient energy. According to the linked Wikipedia article (additional references available there), MCTs (Medium-chain triglycerides) are easy for the body to absorb and use (they require less digestion and less energy to use). MCTs are also purported to have appetite-surpressing and energy-burning benefits (Wikipedia article has links on both sides of that debate). The idea of butter (especially organic butter from pasture-raised animals) is to provide beneficial fatty acids (organic/pasture-raised butter purportedly having better Omega-3 content (see another <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/6707"">skeptics.SE question about this</a>) and vitamins -- both being purported for ""energy"" benefit. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Yes. Preparation has a significant affect on the flavor profile of coffee - including the level of acidity. </p>

<h1>Distribution of Acidity by Brewing Method</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bvYFi.png"" alt=""Boxplot of Sour &amp; Acidity by brewing method""></p>

<p>If I may present to you... the distribution of acidity in coffee by brewing method! 
Clearly and without surprise, Espresso (coffee extracted under pressure) is the most acidic preparation method, on average. French Press (full immersion brewing) is the least acidic, and V60 (a type of pour-over) has the widest range.</p>

<p><strong>But is there something else going on here?</strong> 
What if there exists a conflating factor such as green processing, roast level, or growing environment? Some of these questions we're already answered in the link above, so lets focused on the remaining question - how does the origin of the coffee effect the perceived acidity of the coffee by brewing method? </p>

<hr>

<h1>Acidity by Brewing Method Controlling for Continent of Origin</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mie4a.png"" alt=""Acidity by brewing method controlling for continent""></p>

<p>So is the effect of brewing method consistent? No. 
What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee. </p>

<p>Oh... you should have just said so.... </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmild.png"" alt=""Inference Tree of Acidity in Coffee""></p>

<p>This is a conditional inference tree mapping the distribution of acidity scores to a series of categorical variables. </p>

<pre><code>Where:
C is Country 
P is Preparation 
G is Green Processing
and the bar plot shows the distribution of acidity
</code></pre>

<p>Country is clearly the most used variable in creating this tree, and interestingly, Green Processing is only used as a splitting rule when a country has a variety of green processing methods in common use. </p>

1501,2,,2015-02-17T19:40:08.450,6,,"<p>There seems to be a very blurred line between actual nutritional energy (calories) and stimulants (caffeine) in many people's mind.  It is an oxymoron to have a zero calorie energy drink, but there are plenty of them on the market.  That being said, there are many coffee drinks out there that add calories to your morning stimulant routine.  Encouraging a healthier source of calories isn't necessarily a bad thing.</p>

<p>A cup of black coffee has almost no calories (no energy).  Adding anything to that coffee that provides a significant source of calories (milk, sugar, chocolate, whip cream, butter, flavored syrup) will provide actually nutritional energy as opposed to just the stimulant effect that black coffee provides.</p>

<p>All that being said when you start claiming you have magic beans and that all the other coffee in the world is hosting some sort of fungus party, I feel you've crossed the line into marketing snake-oil.  My perhaps favorite quote from that site:</p>

  <p>Roasting the beans enhances their antioxidant capacity and flavor to
  provide you with a healthier, tastier cup of coffee.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Data</strong> </p>
  
  <p>7,371 Reviews of Central American Washed Coffees brewed in Chemex, Beehouse, kalita wave, or  V60 with a paper filter</p>
  
  <p>Average of 7 day old coffee with a SD of 5 days, the data is evenly dichotomously split between a ratio of 40:600 and 35:400 (up-dose) <code>grams of water : grams of coffee</code></p>

  <p>Average of 30 day old coffee with a SD of 10 days, brewed at approx 50g coffee to 180 ml water</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h1>Differences in the Beans - before preparation</h1>

<p>Proper <strong>Nel</strong> uses old beans, usually a month past roast - <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off/166#166"">often considered stale!</a> This is a historical antecedent - fresh coffee was hard to come by when the dutch we're the only trading partner (for some time, and the only one shipping coffee) for Japan.</p>

<p><strong>Pour-Over</strong> Methods produce the best flavor profile using fresh coffee (less than 14 days from roast, on average). </p>

<hr>

<h1>Differences in Preparation</h1>

<p><strong>Nel:</strong> Very high coffee to water ratio, hovering around ~50g coffee to ~200g water. Very slow pour. It should take at least 6 min to pour the water through the grinds.</p>

<p><strong>Pour-over:</strong> More standard coffee to water ration, often around ~40g coffee to ~600g water. Standard pour rate, with total brew time around 4 min. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Differences in Flavor Profile</h1>

<p>For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).</p>

<p>Bulletproof coffee is often used with a low-carb diet, often referred to as the ""keto diet"", which has some similarities with Paleo, but is quite different. The diet requires you to cut out as many carbohydrates as possible out of your diet in order to get your body into a state of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis"" rel=""nofollow"">ketosis</a>, where most of the energy in the body is produced by processing fat instead of carbohydrates.</p>

<p>When following the keto diet, you need to eat a lot of fat, minimum carbohydrates and a reasonable amount of protein. The goal is to get most of your calories from fat. Getting in all the fat that is required is often difficult, so in that context, bulletproof coffee is nothing more than a delivery method for fat. There's nothing special about it, it's just easier to drink a spoonful of butter melted in coffee than eating it on its own.</p>

The end result of that was in consistence and taste not much different from classic (drip, so to say) coffee, but had a notable and interesting by-taste of egg.</p>

<p>This was quite bit unusual to me and I didn't ever encounter this recipe again (yet am not an expert on the topic either).

<p>There seem to be a variety of approaches, but they seem to fall into three main camps:</p>

<li>Add just the white and the shell</li>
<li>Add just the <em>yolk</em> and the shell</li>
<li>Add the whole egg, including the shell</li>
</ul>
<p>Across the different techniques, adding the shell was the only real unifying theme! It's said to reduce bitterness (I imagine because the shell is essentially calcium-carbonate, which is basic). The technique is to just crush up the shell, mix it and the egg contents with the coffee and pour over boiling water.</p>
<p>The grounds will bind with the egg protein and sink in the cup. They can then be strained off.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, it just tastes like coffee (the egg is hardly noticeable, and just tones down the flavor a bit like cream or milk). Using one or two more eggs (for a full pot like this) would probably have helped. Also, make sure you let the coffee cool enough before tempering your eggs, or you'll just wind up with scrambled egg floating in coffee despite the fact that you tempered it.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>80 g coarsely ground coffee (roughly 200 mL) </p></li>
<li><p>1 egg</p></li>
<li><p>100 mL cold water</p></li>
<li><p>2.5 L boiling water</p></li>
<li><p>250 mL cold water</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mix coffee with an egg and 100 mL cold water to a thick paste. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You simply mix your coffee with an egg plus 100 ml/ a fifth of a pint of cold water with something like a spoon until it becomes a thick paste. It should get harder as the paste thickens along the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add this mixture to the boiling water (2.5 L in a pot on the stove over a fire to be exact), stir carefully and leave to boil for 2-3 min. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put the paste in boiling water that is placed in a metal pot over a fire on a stove. Stir carefully then leave the mixture to boil for 2 to 3 minutes. There will be a difference in the end product depending on how much you stirred it:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/89GL4.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Difference between much (left) and little (right) stirring as the coffee boils as seen from the precipitate at the bottom of a glass of egg coffee. <strong>PythonMaster's Note</strong>: This is the caption for the picture above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next step is actually the next step in the recipe, not a caption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remove pot from stove and add the remaining cold water</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, remove your pot from the stove and then add remaining 250 ml of cold water into the pot. Pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let the grounds settle for a couple of minutes, skim off any floating particles, filter through a fine meshed sieve, a cheese cloth or filter paper and serve. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Place the mixture somewhere and let the grounds settle for a couple minutes (You probably want to put this in a cup or container).

Then after it settles, put the mixture through some type of sieve (please have container underneath or you will have a really delicious mess to clean up) and finally... <strong><em>DRINK AND SERVE!</em></strong></p>

They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter.</p>

<p>In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think <strong>you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub</strong>. However, <strong>any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew</strong> (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/123/262"">this question about coffee going stale</a> -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/160/262"">this question about what's happening</a> with stale coffee.)</p>

<p><strong>Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long</strong> as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow.</p>

<p>As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/51953/25286"">this question/answer on Cooking.SE</a> recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean.</p>

<p>A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter. You could toss the whole thing into your compost bin (filter and spent grounds and all!) and everything on the coffee maker will dry out more quickly. </p>

<p>Lots of things make a good cup of espresso; some people like (or think they like) single origin expensive marketing-buzzword-infused coffees, and others have found other roasts / blends that work just as well for them. You can use whatever you want in your aeropress to make a cup of joe that suits you.</p>

Since and Aeropress (disclaimer, I don't have one, but I have used them while backpacking quite a lot) tends to extract a lot of flavor, a medium roast will probably prevent your coffee from being too dark, and still provide a lot of flavor. You'll also want a nice fine grind, which is generally what you want for any espresso machine.</p>

1526,2,,2015-02-19T17:55:30.147,5,,"<p>99% of the coffee I drink is single origin since I roast my own and don't buy blends.  That being said I also have an Aeropress I use 2 or 3 times a week to make coffee (I use a drip machine or clever dripper the rest of the time).  What I have found is that any coffee I buy/roast that ISN'T recommended as a SO espresso tastes poor to me when brewed with my Aeropress.  I have solved this issue for myself by no longer buying beans that aren't recommended as a SO espresso.  </p>

<p>My untested hypothesis from this is that most coffees that would not do well as espresso will also not do well as aeropresso.  While the resulting coffee from an Aeropress is not espresso, the brew methods share enough in common and the results are similar enough (not the same, but similar) that they have (my opinion) quite a bit in common with what beans do well when brewed in that manner.</p>

<p>Single origin versus blended don't mean anything out of the context of how they taste.  It's possible to have a poorly grown and processed single origin that won't be great no matter how it's brewed, but it's still single origin.  It's also possible to find blends that are done so for a variety of bad reasons (to produce a consistent, but not great taste, to reduce costs, etc) or blends that are done for the right reasons (to get a specific taste profile that may not be possible with any single origin, but IS great).  There are great and less than great single origin coffees.  There are also great and less than great blends.  I thing that some folks have biases against blends because in the past they were most often done for cost or consistency reasons and not necessarily for the best flavor. </p>

<p>TL;DR I would likely recommend anything that should be good for espresso (single origin or blend) and high quality as a good candidate for Aeropress brewing.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusions.</strong> Note that I am <em>not</em> including <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_jelly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coffee jelly</a>, which is made of (conventional, roasted) brewed coffee, as noted previously; also <em>not</em> including making a jam out of roasted or un-roasted coffee <em>beans</em> themselves. Both of those are interesting concepts, but discounted here to be left as separate topics.</p>

<p><strong>Progress!</strong> I searched a bunch for a source of <em>any</em> coffee cherries or dried husks. Amazon didn't even seem to sell any (must have been my error!?). I asked around at a few local coffee shops, with little progress. I found a few pages, <a href=""http://blog.kathrynmcgowan.com/tag/dried-coffee-cherries/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this one</a> and one from <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/grass-fed-pop-some-coffee-cherries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a NYT blog</a> that gave a glimmer of hope that husks (at least) could be found. Both of those articles point to <a href=""https://counterculturecoffee.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Counter Culture Coffee</a> as selling these, but they're not in stock. An immensely helpful person from CCC pointed me to <a href=""http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/collections/coffee/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Verve Coffee Roasters, who sell coffee cherry husks for cascara</a>.

<p>Overall it's a gimmick; but that's not to say there's zero science behind it, but the science only seems to conclude that all the claims Bulletproof makes are complete bullshit.</p>

<p>Mycotoxins are NOT contained in the microbiota involved in the fermentation process of coffee. Mycotoxins are one of many of the by-products created by the microbiota from fermentation. These by-products are washed off from the bean during pre and post-fermentation processing (regardless of wet or dry processing), and even then are only in extremely minute amounts if not zero. Further, apparently the mycotoxins are made inert after the roasting process.</p>

<p>Bitterness in coffee can be a result of a few things. The roast itself, and the brewing. Roasting the coffee at higher temperatures (normal roasting temps are from 300-500F) and longer roast times, can add to the tannins that are perceived as bitter. Those tannins can then be extracted from the coffee if brewed for longer times and higher water temperatures.</p>

1530,2,,2015-02-20T00:56:07.503,3,,"<p>I suppose flavor won't be changed. Most coffee beans are grown <strong><em>just like that</em></strong>. They require shade or they will die of too much sunlight. Having too much water will sometimes drown the plant to death. Here is a <a href=""http://www.coffeehunter.com/articles/shade_grown_coffee_agronomist%E2%80%99s_perspective"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> that lists three main disadvantages and some advantages to shade grown coffee.</p>

<ul>
<li>Too much shade will cause fungal infections</li>
</ul>

<p>If the plant is under too much shade, fungi-related infections will attack and feed on the plant. This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead.</p>

<ul>
<li>The real definition of shade-grown is not really rock-solid. Many places will have varying amounts of shade due to their altitudes.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant.</p>

<ul>
<li>The further south (or, north) a farm is located from the Equator, the less need there is for shade cover to protect coffee plants from the rays of the sun: the strength of the sun's rays in, for example, Brazil (where the sun is at an angle) is far less than the direct overhead rays from Central America. Thus, while shade cover may prove advantageous in Central America it might actually lead to a fall in yield of crops in Brazil.</li>
</ul>

<p>This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed.</p>

<p>There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting. I hope this helps you!  </p>

1531,2,,2015-02-20T01:31:29.573,11,,"<p>There are many difference between the two filters. In this <a href=""https://www.baltcoffee.com/content/whats-difference-between-brown-filters-and-white-filters"">website</a>. it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one.</p>

<h1>Speaking of Performance...</h1>

<p>In this <a href=""http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm"">website</a>,it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Natural brown : In its natural form, all paper is brown colored, so brown filters are completely unprocessed. Other than aesthetics and processing, there are no other differences in color.</li>
  <li>White : White paper filters are processed to get that clean, white shade. Chlorine bleaching or natural oxygen bleaching are common methods for whitening paper. Generally, better quality paper ones do not use chlorine bleach.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews.</p>

<h1>Taste</h1>

<p>Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the <a href=""http://www.sweetmariascoffee.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=833"">website</a> where all the information of this section came from.</p>

<h1>Environmental Impacts</h1>

<p>Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since they’re made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more “green,” compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the <a href=""http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/benefits-using-coffee-filters-7625.html"">website</a> that provided the paragraph.</p>

1539,2,,2015-02-20T15:52:35.743,16,,"<p>In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup <em>and</em> from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching.</p>

<p>A <a href=""http://organon.jimhufford.com/2010/03/things-ive-always-wondered-about-cooling-saucer-edition/"">blog post</a> contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses <a href=""http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html"">the use of <em>deep</em> saucers</a> for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, <a href=""http://www.senate.gov/legislative/common/briefing/Senate_legislative_process.htm"">according to US government legend</a>, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like <a href=""http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/behaviourfood.html"">eating peas off the back of one's fork</a>. Cooling a portion in the saucer would alleviate the need for potentially-impolite-seeming slurping or blowing across the beverage to cool it, substituting instead acrobatic-prowess-demonstrating yet possibly-more-polite sipping off of a saucer.  Other discussion forums (<a href=""http://aforum.genealogi.se/discus/messages/2450/91396.html?1269309231"">one example</a>) contain some additional anecdotes and pictures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Place the pot over a low flame. A low flame increases the brew time, which enhances the flavor. At a later step, you’ll want a slow trickle of espresso instead of a full-force fountain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would want a nice, long brew time. The flavor will be enhanced rather than the quick brew time with a large fire. So flavor and brew time can be changed depending on the size of your heat. To answer that question, <strong><em>YES</em></strong> it is a great idea to turn down the heat. <strong>EXTRA</strong>: The site also shows how to make a nice moka (not spam)! Second, you really answered your last question yourself. Low heat is better than high heat.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to answer your second question. Looks like this <a href=""http://whatscookingamerica.net/Beverage/MokaEspressoPot.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a> uses Italian pots just like your induction hob. For stovetop pots and not stovepot pots, it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the water in the tank has been exhausted, that's when you hear the ‘gurgle’ that signifies the drink is ready to pour (approximately 4 to 5 minutes).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like 4 to 5 minutes is just the right time for the coffee to be ready for extraction here. You should know the sound of someone using mouthwash and gurgling. The coffee pot will start to produce that sound when coffee is ready.</p>

<p>Now I will answer your first question. I can't seem to find any significant information on your question, so I'll take a shot at it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Supposedly, it might be your decision. </p>

1544,2,,2015-02-21T15:56:33.993,0,,"<p>Your first question's answer: <strong><em>YOU MUST USE A FILTER!</em></strong> How do you think you can make good, quality coffee on any coffee-maker without a filter? It lets the good stuff go through and keeps the bad stuff out (if it is high-quality or just decent enough).</p>

<p>Your second question. So siphons so use metal filters, but they are either rare or even not produced anymore. Your cloth description is right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A piece of cloth can however get dirty, rough, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>if you don't know when or how to clean it. In good quality plus cleaning, they can be used up to 100 times or even more. In this <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/siphoncoffee"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a> (which states all types of filters and how to change them), it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My cleaning regimen for cloth filters has changed over the years. Cloth filter assemblies should be cleaned right after use with a soft brush and running water, and then soaked in a solution of oxyclean and boiling water. Rinse well after, and store dry. 
  This will not harm the cloth like bleach will, and it comes out sparkling white and odor free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oxyclean is a product that is like washing detergent. Cleans up cloth and fabric quickly and nicely, bringing out good results. Boiling water will help out with the cleaning and disinfecting of the cloth. It will literally burn and kill any harmful bacteria on your cloth. You should clean the cloth immediately after use. This will keep the cloth in top-shape for a <em>long</em> time in its ""life"" span.</p>

<p>Paper filters' cleaning ways are obvious. One use and they are thrown right into the trash. You really can't clean paper filters.</p>

<p>Cleaning glass filters (in my opinion) should be cleaned right after used. They are pretty rare and easily broken when not receiving enough care. Just clean it like any other glass product. Put water on a paper towel and wipe it clean.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rough (but not sharp) surface of the middle was the filter - coffee grounds would get trapped in the little channels between the bumps, but liquid would still pass through. In practice, these glass filters allow a fair amount of sediment to pass into the brewed coffee. Some find this beneficial, others do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The choice of using this filter is your decision depending on what you want from your filter.</p>

<p>Nylon mesh are easily cleaned: they're dishwasher safe. Yet, they are breakable and fragile at the same time. Be careful with these guys.</p>

1545,2,,2015-02-21T20:56:11.277,4,,"<p>In short: <strong>Using a cezve of the correct size works better.</strong> The situation is similar to using appropriate equipment size in other coffee preparation methods (other examples at the bottom).  That said, you can probably brew a passable cup of <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/483/difference-between-turkish-and-greek-coffee"">Turkish (or other names)</a> coffee when your <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cezve</a> isn't full to the neck (or, using a cezve that's ""too large""). </p>

<p>However, there are reasons for the shape and size of a cezve (as you suggest in your question), and it really does help in practice:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The narrower neck of the cezve keeps the foam form.</strong> I haven't found any good references for an explanation; more discussion below.</li>
<li><strong>It's easier to see what's happening.</strong> Using a bigger pot, it would be more difficult to see when the boiling/foaming is happening. Some stir it down during brewing, some don't; either way, timing is important!</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a bunch of brewing guides that suggest reasons; <a href=""http://www.howtobrewcoffee.com/Turkish.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>  suggests stirring down several times, and says the size is due to <strong>""physics""</strong> without explanation; <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/01/how-to-make-turkish-coffee-at-home-in-an-ibrik-instructions-tips-technique-coffee-brewing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's another</a>. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/turkishcoffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This one from CoffeeGeek</a> suggests that the shape (narrowing toward the top) helps <strong>to prevent the foam from burning to the side of the pot</strong> (becoming bitter); this makes sense especially when using a small pot on a gas stove, when the heat will try to hug the sides of the pot. And <a href=""http://www.freshcup.com/brewing-turkish/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> doesn't say to stir. All of them suggest, but none that I could find explicitly <em>state</em> the reason why the foam forms better.  In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing. </p>

<p>Other examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Moka pot. The size of the pot determines how much you brew at a time; can't really make more or less (though you <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1519/how-should-i-make-multiple-batches-quickly-with-a-moka-pot"">could brew a few pots in a row</a>). See also <a href=""/questions/tagged/moka"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;moka&#39;"" rel=""tag"">moka</a>.</li>
<li>Espresso. Though you can make a single or double, and a <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/408/what-is-the-difference-between-a-long-luongo-and-a-short-ristretto-shot-of-e"">long or short</a>, you pretty much have to <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/415/how-do-i-know-when-to-stop-pulling-my-shot/"">stop pulling at the right time</a>.</li>
<li>Cone filter. For example, #2 and #4 and #6 coffee filters exist for a reason: it's hard to get a good pour of a 12-cup carafe of drip/filter coffee through a #2 filter; it's just too small.</li>

  <p>Certainly it's an old tradition in Sweden. You pour the coffee from your cup into the saucer and sip it - usually quite noisily - after blowing a little on it (to cool it). Dricka på fat (drink from a plate, i.e. saucer) can be combined with dricka på bit (drink with a lump, i.e. lump of sugar). You take the lump of sugar between your teeth and sip your coffee (from the saucer) through the sugar. 
  Neither of these customs are, however, common in polite society... And, generally speaking, I've only ever seen older people do it, years ago, and in the countryside. 
  Today's urban and international Swedes are more likely to have a latte - without sugar - in a tall glass, no saucer. </p>

Typically, after a week or so we soak the cloth in oxyclean or similar for a couple of hours to get it super clean and then follow this up with a normal wash and thorough rinse.

I buy the cheapest brown filters available, so I think it's unlikely that my filters ""don't need rinsing"" or so, but perhaps they're so cheap as to ""not benefit from rinsing."" <a href=""http://landofathousandhills.com/fromtheroastmaster/why-you-should-rinse-your-paper-filter-before-brewing/"" rel=""noreferrer"">This article</a> suggests some filter taste-tests, so I did them and more. </p>

<p><strong>My experiments:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I poured water through rinsed and non-rinsed filters and tasted the water that went through the filter. Both taste faintly of paper, but I see no difference;</li>
<li>I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference;</li>
<li>I have even gone so far as to chew on rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters to see if I could tell a difference. (<strong>Edit:</strong> to be clear, I chewed on these filters only to see if I taste a difference between rinsed and non-rinsed paper filters, <em>not</em> to somehow ""condition"" the filter before brewing use)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My conclusions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Paper filters taste terrible</strong> -- mine anyway -- rinsed or not. I may have to revisit <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"">this question on brown versus white filters</a>, buy better paper filters, or use a <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/434/how-does-nel-drip-compare-to-paper-filtered-pour-over"">cloth-filtered Nel pot</a>.</li>
<li><strong>I wasted a lot of filters doing these tests</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In fact, after using a pre-rinsed filter I got a ""structural failure"" -- the bottom of the filter broke -- when brewing pour-over with a heavily rinsed filter. I'll probably have to eat some better-quality or white paper filters to make this fair.</p>

<p>In sum, my only conclusion is that <strong>quickly rinsing the inside <em>and</em> outside</strong> of the filter is the only way for this to have any benefit. I'm discounting any other benefit of pre-rinsing, such as rinsing with hot water would warm ceramic cone filter-holder or pot/mug.</p>

<p>About 15 minutes in...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And the reason we thought that -- in other words, people in the
  cooking world were looking for cooking universals. They were looking
  for one way to treat all of us. And it's good reason for them to be
  obsessed with the idea of universals, because all of science, through
  the 19th century and much of the 20th, was obsessed with universals.
  Psychologists, medical scientists, economists were all interested in
  finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave. But that
  changed, right? What is the great revolution in science of the last
  10, 15 years? It is the movement from the search for universals to the
  understanding of variability. Now in medical science, we don't want to
  know how necessarily -- just how cancer works, we want to know how
  your cancer is different from my cancer. I guess my cancer different
  from your cancer. Genetics has opened the door to the study of human
  variability. What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying, this same
  revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce. And for that,
  we owe him a great vote of thanks.</p>
  
  <p>I'll give you one last illustration of variability, and that is
  -- oh, I'm sorry. Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step, which was to say that when we pursue universal principles
  in food, we aren't just making an error; we are actually doing
  ourselves a massive disservice. And the example he used was coffee.
  And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafe. If I
  were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a
  type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy, and then I asked
  you to rate that coffee, the average score in this room for coffee
  would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. If, however, you allowed me
  to break you into coffee clusters, maybe three or four coffee
  clusters, and I could make coffee just for each of those individual
  clusters, your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78. The difference
  between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee
  that makes you wince, and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.</p>

1558,2,,2015-02-24T00:36:52.153,4,,"<p>Let's answer your first question first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's the best way to rinse a paper filter? Inside, outside, both? Soak? Hot or cold water?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't really rinse <em><strong>only</strong></em> the outside/inside of a paper filter. When you drop water on a piece of paper, it doesn't just stick onto the outside/inside, it soaks <em><strong>both</strong></em> sides of the paper filter. So, both sides. You probably want to soak your filter. This will get rid of any unnecessary chemicals and oils filtered from your filter. This will help make your coffee taste better. Your Serious Eats article is <em><strong>very</strong></em> accurate. Well, soaking in hot water should do. Hot water will might peal off some paper plus a lot of harmful stuff. It is one-kill wonder for bacteria. The hot water will burn your harmful bacteria to death. So answering your first question: Both, Yes, Hot Water</p>
<p>Now let's answer your second question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does it help?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, filters are needed to keep coffee clean by extracting and &quot;keeping&quot; the chemicals and oils. Then, what cleans the filters? This is where rinsing comes in. Let me show you an example. Your clothes keep you clean then you put them in the washing machine to get them clean. So the rinsing is just like the washing machine. Over time, the paper will absorb so many chemicals and oils, the performance goes down like a rock. Some trapped chemicals will join the coffee, allowing the coffee to be contaminated and less tasty. Rinsing will allow the hot water to kill the bacteria and let the filter transfer the chemicals to the water, where it will belong somewhere in a sewer. This will leave the filter very clean.</p>
<p>And now I will answer your bonus question (Do you award extra rep for this ;-)?):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is being rinsed off?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the chemicals and oils of course! As said in my previous answer, the water will take the chemicals and oils to the sewer with it. The pores in which the filter needs to cleanse are then empty and more useful. Paper sometimes peel off but will end in the sewer like the chemicals and the water. After one use, it is time for the trash. Of course, first-timers will have to learn that dust and other particles will also ruin the flavor and filter. That is really the &quot;dusty stuff&quot;.</p>
<h1>Bonus Information About Your Experiments:</h1>
<p>Looks like they don't work. Sure, most coffee filters will add a papery taste to your coffee, depending on its quality. First, doing the first experiment doesn't really do anything. You need to add coffee, not water, to see a difference. An bad, uncleaned filter will add a papery taste plus some more unwanted taste into your coffee. A good, rinsed filter will add a tiny papery taste to your coffee. Adding something in which it has flavor will make the experiment more fun (a lot more coffee to taste) and effective. That also goes to your second experiment which almost is the first experiment itself for some reason... Anyways, chewing paper filters will <strong>absolutely</strong> not do anything. All that does is leave you complaining and spitting for the next 12 hours. You might need a mint and some mouthwash after that for personal hygiene reasons :-).</p>

<p>With any preparation, roast level is a bit of personal preference. However, certain roasts are more common or <em>generally</em> taste better with certain preparations (cf., ""espresso roast"" or so).</p>

<p>How about for cold brew? Aside from personal preference, <strong>is there something about cold brew that lends itself to better extraction with a certain roast level?</strong></p>

Generally speaking, lighter roasts will have <em>higher</em> acid content. The combination of these two seems to suggest (to me, anyway) to the conclusion that one can use lighter roasts for cold brew (i.e., lighter than you might otherwise enjoy).</p>

<p><strong><em>Extraction:</em></strong>
<br><strong>The <em>amount of the original mass</em> of the grounds that ends up in the brewed coffee</strong>. Though it certainly depends on the preparation method (""method of extraction"", e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is <strong>about 20%</strong> (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee). </p>

<p><strong>Less than ~15%-18% extraction is considered ""under-extracted"" and can be sour.</strong> That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the fact that acids are extracted quickly. On the other hand, <strong>more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered ""over-extracted"" and can be bitter</strong>, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.  </p>

I have furthermore been unable to avoid philosophical diversion and hypothetical questions in this answer; please forgive me. :)</p>
<p>As @EricPlaton noted in comments, the answer depends on a slightly different question: <strong>What characteristics define real espresso?</strong> Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <em>traditional espresso machine</em> (See <a href=""http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/%7Ebob/Coffee/timeline.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this history of espresso machines and production techniques</a> for one view of what is <em>traditionally</em> espresso), and</li>
<li><em>capsule-based &quot;espresso&quot; systems</em>. There are several capsule-based espresso machines (<a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/three-new-capsule-espresso-systems/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here's a review of Nespresso and three others</a>). You place a small coffee-filled capsule (a.k.a. &quot;pod&quot;, made of aluminium, plastic, paper-wrapped, compressed puck, or other material) into the machine and press a button; seconds later it produces a coffee beverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>My answers:</p>
<h2>No.</h2>
<p>In simple point of fact, <strong>espresso is not <em>traditionally</em> made with a coffee-filled capsule</strong>, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :)</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/en/The-Certified-Italian-Espresso.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">INEI</a> being a benchmark of <a href=""http://www.espressoitaliano.org/files/File/istituzionale_inei_hq_en.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">espresso production standards (PDF)</a>, <strong>capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone</strong>, with regard to &quot;Certified Italian Espresso&quot; at least. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>quantity of coffee (e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nespresso"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nespresso might be light</a>);</li>
<li>hot water should be used for espresso (some do use pressurized water; but it's not INEI espresso if the capsule system uses steam);</li>
<li>Some capsule systems (as noted by @EricPlaton below) <em>do</em> produce espresso-machine pressures, but there could be benefit (or problems) by <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/296/downsides-of-brewing-espresso-with-high-pressure"">using pressure that is too high</a>, or on the other hand <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1563/262"">too low</a> for extraction and crema. That said, <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress"">it seems that AeroPress can create crema</a> at lower pressures, so perhaps the capsule systems produce a beverage more like AeroPress than espresso.[1]</li>
</ol>
<h2>Maybe.</h2>
<p>There have been several taste-tests of questionable &quot;legitimacy&quot; between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. <a href=""http://aeon.co/magazine/culture/julian-baggini-coffee-artisans/"" rel=""noreferrer"">One four-subject test</a> gave <em>higher marks</em> to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. <a href=""http://www.airtightinteractive.com/2008/09/starbucks-versus-nespresso-taste-test/"" rel=""noreferrer"">This one</a> agrees. Another test disagreed, <a href=""http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/04/nespresso-coffee-overpriced-rubbish/"" rel=""noreferrer"">giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review</a>. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes.</p>
<p>As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better?</p>
<h2>It doesn't matter.</h2>
<p>This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a <em>consistent</em> result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), <strong>what difference does it make if it's <em>&quot;real&quot;</em> espresso or not?</strong></p>

<p>The valve on the bag is there to let gas out without letting gas in. The reason for this is that freshly roasted beans will continue to give off a bit of CO2 for a little while. Coffee that's packaged immediately after roasting will give off a bit in the bag, hence the need for a valve.</p>

<p>Oxygen causes coffee to go off, which is why we keep our coffee in airtight containers to preserve it as long as possible. It's why the valve on the bag is designed to prevent air from the outside getting in.</p>

<p>I've been doing an alt. version of Bulletproof Coffee for about 2 yrs and have had good results. For my version, I use freshly roasted beans from my local farmer's market (they roast on site), Coconut Oil, and Stevia as a sweetener. I also use a <a href=""http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10076320/"" rel=""noreferrer"">mini aerator</a> from ikea ($2.49) to mix it. This is very important unless you like an oily film on top of your coffee.</p>

<p>I use organic Coconut Oil rather than Grass fed butter for two reasons: 
 1. Coconut Oil is much easier for me to find
 2. IMO, it tastes better than the butter</p>

<p>I tried the grass fed butter, and it was pretty good, but like I said. The coconut oil is much easier to find in stores and it actually tastes better. The butter does give the coffee a creamy texture that's good though, so I'd try both just to see which one you like better. I tried the MCT oil for a while and noticed that it can be a tad harsh on my digestive system, so I cut it. </p>

<p>As for results, in addition to having a significant boost in energy in the AM, I also noticed health benefits. My good cholesterol (HDL) was through the roof at my last physical. While my LDL was really low. My Doc asked what I was eating, and I told him about my Bulletproof experiment and he said it appears to be working at least for my HDL.</p>

<p>As for added benefits for workouts, I don't really notice a huge difference with coffee alone. When I add a NO2 booster to the bulletproof coffee, I do feel a big difference, but that may not be for everyone. </p>

<p>So, I said all that to say, it does work...to an extent. But I'd definitely advocate a DIY version rather than buying a bunch of overpriced products with highly questionable added benefits. </p>

<p>I hope this helps. I'd be happy to answer any other questions. </p>

Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  <strong>My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down.</strong></p>

<p>Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>[1] pretty good <a href=""http://www.air-n-water.com/coffee-filters-information.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">pro/con overview from air-n-water</a> (obscure?);</li>
<li>[2] from <a href=""http://worldofcaffeine.com/2011/06/20/filter-drip-coffee-paper-vs-metal-filters/"" rel=""noreferrer"">World of Caffeine</a>;</li>
<li>[3] from <a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/281062-health-effects-of-gold-coffee-filters/"" rel=""noreferrer"">LiveStrong</a>, which advocates permanent filters (but has other statements with which I disagree);</li>
<li>[4] from <a href=""http://www.melitta.com/en/Why-We-Filter-1662.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Melitta</a>, but this may need a grain of salt, because they're in the business of making paper filters :)</li>
</ul>

<p>From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written <em>a lot of text</em> here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on <strong><em>paper versus metal mesh</em></strong>, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material.</p>

<p><strong>Material.</strong> There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>metal mesh (stainless steel or ""gold tone"");</li>
<li>nylon (or other plastic) mesh;</li>
<li>perforated metal (thin metal sheet with holes);</li>
<li>fabric (e.g., flannel, muslin, hemp).</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most.</p>

<p>One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-brown-and-white-paper-filters-compare"">this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Performance.</strong> Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters.</p>

<p>Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/414/262"">cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels</a>). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some <em>good</em> things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else.</p>

<p><strong>Flavour.</strong> Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time.</p>

<p><strong>Cost.</strong> Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for ""years"" for a few quid ($/€/£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter.</p>

<p><strong>Clean-up.</strong> Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1518/do-i-need-to-clean-my-drip-brew-coffee-makers-filter-every-time"">how often and how much to clean a permanent filter</a>. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree.</p>

<p><strong>Waste / environmental issues.</strong> I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1551/should-i-rinse-paper-coffee-filters-before-use"">rinse your paper filters</a>, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.</p>

<p><strong>My Conclusion.</strong> For my money, personally, <strong>I prefer the paper filter:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Better flavour and texture (less bitter, less grit);</li>
<li>Convenience (easier to use and keep clean);</li>
<li>I compost the whole thing (paper filter, grounds and all), so the environmental impact is basically on the production end, which I'm okay with.</li>
<li>Marginal health concerns (cafestol/cholesterol; avoiding plastic whenever possible).</li>

1584,2,,2015-03-01T19:55:27.403,5,,"<p>There are a number of concrete factors that will impact the stimulation you get from a cup of coffee, but it probably boils down to <strong>the amount of caffeine (and any other stimulants) that are in your cup</strong> that get extracted from the beans. Here's a few factors that affect the caffeine content of coffee, with links to other related questions on this site:</p>

<ul>
<li>Certain beans have more caffeine (themselves, per mass) than others, so there's more of it to get extracted into the cup;</li>
<li>Certain roasts (e.g., lighter) have more caffeine than others (see also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/29/what-type-of-roast-has-the-lowest-caffeine-content"">lowest-caffeine roast</a>, or <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup"">calculating caffeine content</a>)</li>
<li>Certain preparation methods have more caffeine (e.g., <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/128/what-preparation-method-yields-the-most-caffeine"">caffeine content of preparation methods</a>)</li>
<li>There are factors in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean"">strength and extraction</a> -- e.g., more grounds and higher extraction will generally provide more caffeine.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm lumping this all under ""caffeine"", but there are probably other stimulants in coffee besides caffeine (e.g., as suggested in <a href=""http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/106/23/2935.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> and others). </p>

<p>And then there's the intangible factors in ""stimulation"", such as marketing, cafe atmosphere, and so forth, which might have some other kind of effect (like ""conditioning"" or other ""mind games"") that might help you <em>feel like</em> the coffee is even more stimulating than it would be otherwise.

1586,2,,2015-03-02T03:04:09.993,5,,"<p>There are a pantload of recommendations on tamping, but the one recommendation common to all is... <strong><em>practice!</em></strong> And... The most optimal way of <strong>tamping depends on every individual pull</strong>: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to <strong>pack the grounds uniformly.</strong> Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a ""slanted"" puck; if your grounds are packed <em>more loosely</em> in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks.</p>

<p>That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the grounds uniformly and smooth before tamping. This gives you an even bed of grounds so you can tamp evenly.</li>
<li>15 kg / 30 lb. of pressure. A bath scale could help until one gets this ""by feel"".</li>
<li>Use a heavy tamper. This helps you control all of the other parameters.</li>
<li>Aim for sinking the tamp approximately as far as the bevel (a general rule).</li>
<li>Twisting is not necessary (some do at the end of the compression for ""polishing"", but not necessary).</li>
</ul>

<p>Then there's some controversial bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Knocking"" is something I totally don't understand. The idea is to tap the portafilter so as to somehow redistribute the grounds after tamping. I feel like it would just mess up a good puck, but some recommend it either to ensure uniformity of compression of the bottom and top of the puck, or to get grounds off of the side of the portafilter. More discussion at link [4].</li>
<li>On the ""North, South, West, East"" topic: this illustrates tamping at four points around the portafilter. Since the tamp is <em>slightly</em> smaller than the portafilter, the theory is that tamping at points around the sides helps to prevent grounds from creeping up around the tamp (up the side of the portafilter). It seems to me that an appropriate sized tamp will alleviate most of this, but it seems like a reasonable recommendation. Some guides (e.g., below) recommend this, others don't. More at [1].</li>

This leads to the building of interesting dust-like coffee residuals. While this started out of mere laziness, I meanwhile deliberately refrain from washing it as the result is visually quite appealing and an interesting long-term endeavour to see how that coffee cup evolves over the years.</p>

<p>I am however wondering <strong>if those residuals actually have any kind of influence on the fresh coffee drank from this cup</strong>. Now of course there isn't anything moulding, it's an entirely dry thin dust layer, and I don't really make out any taste difference to a clean cup (as the coffee isn't too much of a high quality product in the first place and I'm not a big tasting expert either). So this might be a stupid question. But for example I heard somewhere (though, that's entirely anecdotal hearsay, too) that you shouldn't wash a tea can with dishwasher but only with water because of some flavoury reasons. So maybe there is actual proper or even scientifically grounded reasoning that the <strong>dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have any kind of influence on the coffee drinking experience, however small and imperceptible, be that flavour-wise or regarding other effects, advantageous or defective</strong>.</p>

1609,2,,2015-03-04T15:43:48.310,9,,"<p>You're actually asking two different questions. </p>

<p>The minute amount of coffee left to evaporate in the bottom of a cup will have completely oxidized and lost virtually all of its volatile compounds (i.e. It probably wouldn't taste very good if you reconstituted it on its own). So when you add more <em>fresh</em> coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat <em>off</em>) flavor component to your brew.</p>

<p>Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any <strong><em>perceptible</em></strong> change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between <em>""100% fresh""</em> and <em>""Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals.""</em></p>

<p>Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of <em>soap</em> on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily <em>tasted</em> if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still <em>essentially</em> coffee (somewhat <em>off</em> coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of ""a few drops"" of <em>off</em> coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no <em>perceptible</em> effect on taste. </p>

<p>I also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is <em>not</em> evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely <em>stainless</em>, so you are not likely building up any patina&hellip; so you are essentially ""washing away"" the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee.

<p>I came across a statistic that surprised me by its meagerness.  According to <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20150323060240/http://www.ncausa.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=880"" rel=""noreferrer"">their website</a>, the National Coffee Association USA has spent $6 million on research funding over the last 20 or so years.  The NCAUSA cites 80 specific investigations that they funded. (I don't know if the trend is up or down over the two decades.)</p>

<p>From reading Antony Wild's <a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/coffee-antony-wild/1112483551?ean=9780393060713"" rel=""noreferrer"">Coffee: A Dark History</a> a few years ago, it was my impression that the coffee industry sets great importance on <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/04/health/coffee-myth-fact/"" rel=""noreferrer"">demonstrable health benefits</a>. See in particular Chapt. 14, Coffee, Science and History.</p>

<p>The book mentions specifically the <a href=""http://vanderbilt.edu/ics/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vanderbilt Institute for Coffee Studies</a> as funded by ""a $6 million grant from the coffee industry"" to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in 1999.  (In 2007 the Institute moved its affiliation from the Medical Center to the Vanderbilt Center for Latin American Studies, but continues investigating ""the health effects of coffee consumption, including potential therapeutic uses"".)  While some of this funding came from NCAUSA, it appears the bulk came from the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), with additional funding by the All Japan Coffee Association and the International Coffee Organization.</p>

<p>The global coffee commodity market has annual sales <a href=""http://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=|||||0901|||4|1|1|2|2|1|2|1|"" rel=""noreferrer"">well-up in the tens of billions($)</a>, so I would expect more in annual research funding than the average $300K/yr reported by NCAUSA.</p>

<p><strong>Added:</strong> Apparently it is difficult for coffee trade associations to survive.  The NCAUSA cited above is ancient in comparison to other organizations mentioned.  The Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/business/world-markets-a-new-coffee-cartel-tries-its-hand.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">began in 1993</a> with a model of OPEC-like price supports through agreed upon limitations of exports, but <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1608356.stm"" rel=""noreferrer"">dissolved at the beginning of 2002</a>.

The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel.  Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds.  Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils.  Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside.  Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good.  My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise.  The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.  </p>

<p>I couldn't believe it would work as well as it did but I'm a believer.  Where it originated, I have no idea, but I have to believe it was away from civilization because the method was so crude.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.ncausa.org/About-Coffee/How-to-Store-Coffee"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>National Coffee Association</em> article on How to Store Coffee</a> advises this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important not to refrigerate or freeze your daily supply of coffee because contact with moisture will cause it to deteriorate.  Instead, store coffee in air-tight glass or ceramic containers and keep it in a convenient, but dark and cool, location. Remember that a cabinet near the oven is often too warm, as is a cabinet on an outside wall of your kitchen if it receives heat from a strong afternoon or summer sun.</p>
<p>The commercial coffee containers that you purchased your coffee in are generally not appropriate for long-term storage. Appropriate coffee storage canisters with an airtight seal are a worthwhile investment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An update to the NCA article adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While there are different views on whether or not coffee should be frozen or refrigerated, the main consideration is that coffee absorbs moisture – and odors, and tastes – from the air around it [...]</p>
<p>If you choose to freeze your coffee, quickly remove as much as you need for no more than a week at a time, and return the rest to the freezer before any condensation forms on the frozen coffee.</p>

<p>""Micro-roasted"" implies that you purchased the beans where the roasting was performed on premises. That means it was probably roasted recently, within a couple of days. Roasts vary, but generally a bean will remain fresh for a week or two, open-air, room temperature from the time of roasting. One person might take two weeks to use a pound of beans. Just keep it in the closed bag, away from temperature extremes.</p>

<p>No coffee will taste fresh after months, no matter the storage. There are gas-valve tins and bags available online. Coffee beans are quite dynamic. The chemistry continues long after the roasting heat is removed. The logic behind one-way valves is that fresh-roasted beans continue to release gasses that were trapped in the beans. I roast coffee beans and store them in a dark cabinet in a wire basket, exposed to the kitchen air. No bean survives more than 10 days. Most often, the flavor actually improves after a few days.</p>

If you don't happen to subscribe to the <a href=""http://www.intsocderm.org"">International Journal of Dermatology</a> you can obtain the <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2007.03119.x/epdf"">PDF of this article</a> for perhaps a small fee.</p>

<p><strong>I don't know if this has been demonstrated in any clinical trials.</strong> I can't find any longitudinal studies of longer-term effectiveness, nor can I find any evidence of actual clinical trials.

<p>""To keep this on-topic..."" As for using instant coffee or some other source of caffeine (e.g., pills) to be applied topically to your scalp, I can't find anything about that either. Concentrations cited in the study are ""0.001% and 0.005%."" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean"">Coffee beans themselves</a> have about 1-4% caffeine before roasting, so it's reasonable to expect that you could get to the concentration used in the study with a paste of instant coffee, but I don't know about the ""bioavailability"" of caffeine from topical application of instant coffee. Robusta beans are generally on the higher end of caffeine content and might be cheaper. Also, green beans will have a higher caffeine content than roasted, but I might be taking this a bit too far...</p>

Different flavours will to some extent interact with each other, and individual preference and taste have something to do with this, but there are particular causes of certain flavours.</p>

<p><em>Sourness</em> is a perception of <em>acidity</em>. In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cola"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cola</a> has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/17395/why-does-adding-sugar-to-sour-things-cause-them-not-to-be-sour"">this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness</a>). I don't see how sugar could be <em>the cause</em> of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). <strong>EDIT:</strong> That said, it <em>might</em> be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar <em>reduces</em> the perception of sourness, but it <em>could</em> be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) <em>dissipates more quickly</em> than the sourness (acids), you might be left with ""more sourness than sweetness"" in the <em>aftertaste</em> after some time. That is, you're left with ""un-maksked"" residual sourness which, though present all along, is more <em>perceptible</em> after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information.</p>

<p><em>Sweetness</em> is perceived by the presence of <em>sugar</em> (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemoreceptor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">perception</a>). Sugar will also impact mouthfeel.</p>

1624,2,,2015-03-07T00:21:07.180,10,,"<p>A few other factors to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Freshly ground beans.</p></li>
<li><p>How you store your coffee beans. You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO<sub>2</sub>. I bought a stack of <a href=""http://fivesenses.com.au/shop/associated/250g-empty-bags"">250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve</a> from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times. These days I use <a href=""http://planetarydesign.com/products/airscape-kitchen-canisters/"">AirScape canisters</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20131017143359/http://dailyshotofcoffee.com/great-coffee-starts-with-the-right-water/"">The water you use.</a> If you wouldn't enjoy drinking your tap water, don't use it to brew coffee. Use the same water you use for drinking water.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any).</p></li>
<li><p>How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness.</p></li>
<li><p>When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness.</p></li>
<li><p>Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation.</p>

<p>With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95&deg;C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. <a href=""http://www.tested.com/food/coffee/455840-how-important-coffee-brew-water-temperature/"">This video</a> gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling.</p>

<p>The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4]</p>

<p>[1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment.</p>

<p>[2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do.</p>

<p>A tricky aspect of this answer is that ""fresh"" does not necessarily mean the ""shortest life"". For example, I like working with green beans that came just a few months ago at most, after they get stable in their new climate. After roasting, the best taste comes up 2-3 days later in our case. And brewing comes right after grinding---always. This example is for illustration purpose; numbers may not serve elsewhere.

1630,2,,2015-03-10T01:07:14.510,4,,"<p>I am answering here as it applies to Italy, elsewhere it can be different.</p>

<p>Cappuccino in Italian means little cappuccio, which in turn means little cap.
It is a milk-and-coffee drink with a peculiar topping:  a milk foam obtained with steam. You might ask to add also some chocolate powder. Apart from the taste, the powder filling the foam pore gives a pleasant look to the drink. When travelling abroad, I see this as a standard feature, but here it is on request.</p>

<p>The steam is produced from a pump part of quite a large coffee machine, which is the  standard equipment of any  Italian bar. Because of the high pressure involved it is normally not possible to produce a cappuccino at home, at least not using a standard stove. Anyway nowadays they are selling cut down versions of the bar machine, which can produce bar-like cappuccinos (and coffee) even at home. </p>

<p>Temperature is crucial for cappuccino. Hot temperature is necessary to produce the foam, but a too hot cappuccino will hurt your tongue. Contrary to a hot cup of tea, where you can wait for it to become  colder, here when the hot goes away also the foam does, so what you drink is not a cappuccino anymore.</p>

<p>Espresso means express, as you might guess. It is a coffee made with the big machine I mentioned above.
Contrary to the coffee made at home on the stove, with the so called moka machine, this machine can make a good coffee instantly. That anyway requires this appliance to be already setup (with proper pressure and temperature levels), which takes time but it is done only once, in the morning, when the bar opens. it might help observing that breakfast is almost inexistent in Italy, as it consists for many of a fast and frugal espresso  or cappuccino with a croissant, taken  standing still at the bar before commuting  to you workplace. So speed in brewing pays.</p>

<p>Besides Italian approach to coffee as a drink is radically different. For what I have seen, in the rest of the world the coffee is drunk in mugs similar to those used for the tea (I am thinking to American coffee for example); here  the size of a coffee cup is extremely small and  this is because the drink is concentrated. To brew the coffee like  this you need water at  high pressure and  high temperature forced  through a  tier of coffee by the coffee machine. </p>

<p>Big espresso machines found in bars are ideal, given their power, to obtain this and generally their output is considered better than moka coffee made at home.</p>

<p>Note that contrary to cappuccino, here the higher the temperature the better the taste. To make it drinkable bars use special cups very thick. The final results is that you don't hurt your lips when you drink, also the volume of liquid  going through your mouth is less, and you don't burn your tongue.</p>

<p>I have read that the total caffeine in an American coffee is higher, anyway the sensation that you have with an espresso is like you are taking something stronger and we even amplify this effect by drinking it fast, often in one shot.</p>

<p>Given the high temperature and pressure, if one does not make the espresso daily, it is very easy to make it  <em>burned</em>, producing something that is  bitter and distasteful. I have seen many  used  to American coffee (big cups), disliking espresso and vice versa. 
Anyway, before deciding that the strong taste of espresso is not for you, make sure you have tasted a professionally  made one.</p>

<p>As I said before, there are now home espresso machines, which are also easy to operate. </p>

<p>Latte is short for latte macchiato, stained milk. The stain is the a little quantity of coffee.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, in Italy the word espresso is a sort of foreigner word not used at all. Perhaps it was in 1800, when the espresso was invented, but now we just say: ""A coffee, please"".   </p>

<p>When using an espresso machine it is advised to 'backflush' your machine with cleaning powder which cleans away a build up of 'tannin' from inside the machine. I expect a similar thing has happened to your carafe. With an espresso machine you're advised to do it weekly with heavy use - so I can imagine an ""inadequate cleansed"" carafe would probably be heavily tannin stained.</p>

I recommend using cold or lukewarm water as this will allow you rub at the (layers of) stain without risk of pain from hot water.</p>

<p>The build-up is largely from water soluble compounds in the coffee, and because the brewing process creates a concentration of these in hot water, as the brew cools these tend to come out of solution.  There will also be tiny particles of ground coffee, small enough to make their way through the filter/basket that holds the original coffee grounds, and these particles act to promote the staining/sedimentation, esp. at the bottom of your carafe.</p>

<p>You've already seen the first evidence of success when the rinse water came out almost as dark as the brewed coffee the carafe normally holds.  It's large a matter of repetition.  However if the carafe were used to hold some coffee mixed with something else, such as milk or creamer, this can make a more difficult cleaning problem (because the fat in milk will act as a binding agent that resists water solution).  I assume that is not the case here since most people in the office will have their own preferences for adding milk or other creamers, if any.</p>

<p>It's a bit easier to see how quickly the staining rinses out of a glass carafe (several rinses may be needed, judging by your description of the build-up), but there's nothing about a steel carafe that would make the staining more difficult to remove.</p>

<p>Lets assume an espresso machine is being used by the OP. A finer grinding can result in 'channeling'. Channeling means the water creates a single channel trough the coffee puck instead of evenly distributed water flow. The single channel will lose its good taste because of the quantity of water it processes. So the result product aquires all of its taste of that single channel. In a matter of seconds you will be left with bitter coffee. The other effect of finer grinding is a longer exposure to the water, because the water takes longer to reach the bottom of the puck because of the fine grind.</p>

<p>Other factors resulting in bitter taste: water quality, bean type, bean freshness and roasting process, tamping (for espresso machines), cleaning of your brewing device, cleaning of your grinder, extraction time, water temperature, and so on. So a lot is involved and a single answer to this broad question cannot be given. Entire books have been written on this topic.</p>

1651,2,,2015-03-20T01:47:44.367,5,,"<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I thought about this more. In sum, I believe that this question (as asked) is not answerable (but it <em>is</em> interesting!). With just about <em>any</em> selected brewing method, you'll be able to extract almost all of the caffeine from the beans. However, depending on the method chosen, you need to use different parameters to get full extraction (time, pressure, temperature, etc.). For example: Espresso is certainly the fastest to get full caffeine extraction, but you need a fine grind.  Filter/drip or French press are slower, but espresso-fine grind just won't work correctly; you need to use a coarser grind. Given the same beans, and the right technique for the given method, you can achieve almost 100% caffeine extraction.  </p>

<p>As an example of drip versus espresso, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on caffeine</a> (and the two cited references that include figures on both espresso and drip caffeine content -- <a href=""https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/caffeine/caffeine_info1.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/the-caffeine-database"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>) claim nearly the same caffeine content for drip versus espresso; in fact, they list that drip coffee has <em>slightly more</em> caffeine than espresso. I can't fully accept these, however, because there's no way to know if they're using arabica or robusta, light roast or dark roast, how much ground coffee was used to brew -- there's just too many unknowns that back those figures. Since arabica, for instance, is ~1% caffeine, with 7g of coffee (""standard dose"", from INEI) you'll be able to get ~70mg caffeine. Those are pretty consistent with the cited figures -- meaning 100% caffeine extraction.</p>

<p>So, you'd have to ask a different question in a different way (e.g., what's the fastest extraction method? or How to get 100% caffeine extraction with cold brew?) or so.</p>

<hr>

<p>I agree with most of @Chris in AK's answer (and +1!), but I wanted to add another take on this.</p>

<p>I don't think solubility is a big factor here; caffeine is <em>very</em> soluble in hot water -- approaching 66g/100mL (~150g/cup) in boiling water, and even at room temperature nearly 2g/100mL (~5g/cup) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Chemical_properties"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">citation listed at Wikipedia</a> and <a href=""http://www.chemicalbook.com/ChemicalProductProperty_EN_CB0202769.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). Yes, those are listed as <em>grams</em>, which means that water could dissolve <em>tens to hundreds of times</em> as much caffeine, as compared to the caffeine dose in an average cup/demitasse of strong coffee or espresso (which contain perhaps ~50mg-200mg per cup; see also questions on caffeine content, such as <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-figure-out-how-much-caffeine-is-in-my-cup"">this</a> and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot"">this</a>; also keep in mind that the <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/469/262"">lethal dose of caffeine</a> is somewhere in the 10g-20g range.)</p>

<p>Back to your actual question, I do agree that you've restricted yourself quite a bit; pressure is one of the few variables you didn't eliminate. To that end: a comparison of extraction of pressure-brewed (e.g., espresso) versus filter/drip follows.</p>

<p>In general, caffeine is quickly extracted from coffee beans (and tea leaves); most is extracted within 30 seconds of water contact (though this certainly depends on fineness of grind and other factors). Here's a visualization of <a href=""http://www.espressoplanet.com/espresso-coffee-machine/pressure_brewed_coffee_extraction.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extraction of comparison of pressure-brewed and drip versus time</a>, which depicts the quantity of caffeine (and other stuff) extracted over time. I found it amusing that the context of that article is actually advocating for espresso as a way to brew <em>lower</em> caffeine content coffee; the point being that the ""other stuff"" (aroma, colour, flavour) is extracted even more quickly with pressure-brewed (versus drip) coffee.  So, if you extract for only 10 seconds (which is <em>very</em> short indeed) you'll get most of the ""other stuff"" but less caffeine. On the other hand, a finer grind will permit faster extraction of caffeine and everything else; <a href=""http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-espresso-vs-drip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article suggests that espresso is higher in caffeine based on the grind factor</a>; I think there are too many other variables for that conclusion.</p>

<p>A big part of the coffee taste (and experience as a whole) is the aroma. I personally find that <strong>paper cups (not surprisingly) <em>smell and taste like paper</em></strong>. Ceramic (or glass, porcelain, etc.) should be practically neutral. Any smell you get from the cup could affect the perception of taste of the contained beverage.

(Aside: there are some interesting links to the physiology of smell and taste interplay at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste"">Wikipedia article on taste</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>The very experience of drinking from a paper cup versus a ceramic cup is different</strong>; heft, shape, handle, other aesthetics, etc., though this probably reduces to personal preference.  For example, I find sometimes that my lip sticks to the outside of the paper cup, which is unpleasant (to me, anyway :). A plastic lid could be a factor here as well.</p>

<p>Temperature may also be a factor. For example, <a href=""http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists"">temperature can affect the perception of bitterness</a>. A properly pre-heated ceramic cup/demitasse will help the brewed coffee be at a consistent temperature (without shocking it after pull) and keep it warmer for longer (so it doesn't cool down too quickly). Such temperature changes could result in a difference in taste; <strong>keeping brewed coffee at a consistent temperature is recommended</strong> -- <a href=""http://www.thecoffeefaq.com/1thebasics.html"">that and some other general properties are listed here</a>. Temperature stability of the brew will probably be different between paper and ceramic.</p>

<h1>Almond</h1>
<p>Not that good as a milk substitute on taste (better alone), yet a great way to make healthier coffee. As for the health benefits, almond milk has good proteins, calcium and Vitamin D, low sugar as long it is unsweetened. It is rather hard to  make latte art or steam as well for a perfect cup. Also it is hard to make a good cappuccino with this type of milk. If going for health, not taste or looks, go for almond milk.</p>
<h1>Soy</h1>
<p>An excellent substitute for your lactose milk. It compliments coffee very well and is very delicious when put in coffee. It creates a great foam and is easier to have be steamed. It has been criticized though for many different reasons. If you are allergic to diary, never use soy milk or any milk at all really. Soy milk can match the consistency and texture of a good cup of coffee. Soy milk is a forgiving milk that goes with many types of coffee. But it does have a lot of sugar though.</p>
<h1>Hemp</h1>
<p>It is similar to soy milk when it comes to steaming and being a favorite substitute for regular milk. Given that it is very easy to make at home, it provides lots of minerals you need such as 46 percent of your daily calcium and about 900 mg of Omega-3. These &quot;resources&quot; are to come by for vegans and vegetarians, so drink up! It has a creamier taste like soy milk and a flavor similar to almond milk, the best combo! Legend says that you can do excellent latte art with this type of milk.</p>

<p>You stated that latte art and steaming well were important and I didn't see you mention wanting healthy options. In that case I would not recommend almond. It will work ok, but not as good as soy. Hemp is comparable to soy based on your needs but might be harder to find depending on where you live.</p>

<p>Lactaid I think is a good option to try. It will steam well and you can do latte art. It will have a sweeter flavor because of the process that removes the lactose. Soy can be purchased sweetened but can also be found mostly unsweetened.</p>

1660,2,,2015-03-23T15:35:37.900,3,,"<p><strong>Science!</strong> What follows is my bogus hypothesis, with pictures (annotated in the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19775/262760"">conventional style</a>) and annotations to bolster my unsubstantiated claims.</p>

<p>Other (non-Chemex) cone-style (and basket-style) filters often have ridges down the inside of the cone. It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help ""wick"" the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader).</p>

<p>Contrasting the two types of cones:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wB2fc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the ""wells"" from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow ""seals"" itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for ""why"" this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the ""seal"" and permits the coffee to drain.</p>

<p>Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar ""ridge"" that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little ""pleats"" in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well.</p>

<p>I find that this ""pooling"" happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the ""sealing,"" but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide</a> suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason.</p>

<p>The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case.</p>

1662,2,,2015-03-23T19:35:36.037,8,,"<p>Here's another take, but going in the direction more of performance for foam (i.e., more for cappuccino than latte), mostly because I found links about that :) and because <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/steamguide"" rel=""noreferrer"">steamed milk should foam</a>. If you're not looking for much foam, the differences are probably less profound.</p>

<p>There's a few other plant-based milks out there also; coconut and rice weren't mentioned in the other answers. In sum, I know of 5 common plant milks: almond, coconut, hemp, rice, soy. But there are probably others as well. </p>

<p>Here's some comparisons, summarized from the linked articles:</p>

<ul>
<li>YouTube video - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR_F9ZikWv8"" rel=""noreferrer"">milk froth-off</a>. They compare rice, coconut, and almond. They got the best performance with almond milk, coconut did almost as well, and rice milk did not perform well.</li>
<li>MarkBittman dot com has an article on <a href=""http://markbittman.com/the-milk-chronicles-in-search-of-vegan-cappuc/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the search for a vegan cappuccino</a>. It suggests that soy is the best alternative for foam, followed by almond. The text and comments suggest (but doesn't outright state) that hemp works well also.</li>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.peacefuldumpling.com/top-3-milk-alternatives-baristas-guide"" rel=""noreferrer"">Peaceful Dumpling</a> article (linked previously in @PythonMaster's answer; summarizing the original article's conclusions here) concludes that soy is best, followed closely by hemp, and that almond doesn't work as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>The conclusions tend to be suggest that cow milk will perform better than plant-based ""milks."" This probably suggests that lactose-free milks (i.e., with lactase, like Lactaid and others) will be <em>your</em> best bet. Of course, you could always take a lactase pill and enjoy your cup with conventional milk. Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work.</p>

<p>There's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut). Others might have emulsifiers or other additives (such as carrageenan), which impact the steaming (maybe helping or hurting).</p>

<p>Another take would be to look at the ""science"" of what happens during steaming: it's a combination of fats and proteins that are being agitated and changed in the right way to make foam.  <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/milk"" rel=""noreferrer"">This CoffeeGeek article</a> discusses frothing and what's at work; this was interesting for me, and might help you pick a milk based on protein and fat content among the various milk options.</p>

Speaking just for my self, I enjoy the hands on approach. It certainly takes more time than an electric grinder, but if you're just grinding for a single cup of French Press or Areopress, it's not that much longer.</p>

<p>In general, though, a burr grinder is much better than a blade grinder. It gives you a more even grind, which allows for better extraction. A decent electric burr grinder costs at least $130. You can get a good hand grinder for about half that. For many people, the cost factor is the important one.</p>

This is generally not true.  There was a time when I would have agreed with you until a change in my brew method showed me otherwise.

They became visible and when I dumped the extracted grounds out onto a paper towel, I was shocked at how many very large - including a few whole beans - there were in the spent grounds.  One side of the spent puck had very fine powder and the other much larger fragments.  </p>

<p>Having learned (from this site) that different flavor profiles from the bean extract at different rates, I could see how a consistent grind would result in a more consistent flavor profile.  I should also say that when I use my blade grinder, looking at the dry grounds, these large fragments <strong>aren't visible at all!</strong>  It's only when they are allowed to separate while brewing that they are obvious.

<p>From my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing ""camp coffee"" is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>percolator</strong></a>. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a ""stovetop espresso maker"", though I don't care for that term) -- there are some <a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5006-001/gsi-stainless-steel-espresso-maker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very <strong>compact moka pots</strong> like this one</a> that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy.

Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me).</p>

<p>Storage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"">especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly</a>.

The method is very simple and I see no reason why you couldn't do the same thing without the eggs.  Here is <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1616/262"">my original answer</a> below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know any history behind the practice but I learned it myself during a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon back in the early '90's. The method was to put a couple of fistfuls of loose grounds in one of those giant porcelain coffee pots that look like they came out of a Zane Grey novel. Follow with two whole uncooked eggs and with a big metal spoon, stir the whole mess in the bottom of the pot, breaking the eggs and mixing it well with the dry grounds. Fill the pot with cold water and put on a hot fire until the thing boils. Take the pot off the fire and open the lid, dribbling about a cup of cold water over the top of the liquid inside. Somehow this settles all the solids to the bottom of the pot and the coffee really tasted pretty good. My take was that the egg sort of smoothed out any harshness the crude method would have introduced to the coffee otherwise. The grounds pretty much stay at the bottom of the pot and were not really a problem in the cup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your method might inlcude a smaller pot and less coffee grounds, but all brew methods are essentially just soaking ground coffee in hot water.  A small French press might also suit your needs just fine.  You should test out your method before you go, though.</p>

1673,2,,2015-03-27T03:47:53.337,12,,"<p>I'm going to answer this in terms of flavor, and then acid.</p>

<p>Generally, people choose more lightly roasted coffee to preserve the terrior flavors of the bean. These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet.</p>

<p>So, it you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew. </p>

<p><strong>I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew.</strong> Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup.</p>

<p>Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less. </p>

<p><strong>In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a french press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast.</strong> Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew.

<p>Any suggestions on how to fix it? I'd love to drink coffee every morning again without having to pay $2 for a large cup of Biggby's coffee. :-)</p>

1676,2,,2015-03-27T18:13:25.023,7,,"<p>If you could be more specific with your question it would be easier to answer.  For example was your previous ""pot"" a percolator or automatic coffee maker or what?  By the same token, what is your current set up?  By a process of elimination you should be able to isolate the factor that's causing your coffee to taste sh***ty.  Basically those are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The coffee itself - is it from the same source, being stored the same, same age, etc.</li>
<li>Same water - you said you'd tried different water sources.  Bottled water should yield good coffee.</li>
<li>The method of brewing, which would include water temperature, coarseness of grind, how long it extracts (steeps), cleanliness of the equipment, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all the factors except the method of brewing are accounted for, then the problem is in the brewing method, which would include the coffee maker.  If you know it's clean and it still tastes bad, you need a different brewing method.  Depending on how much coffee you drink, there are lots of options that will yield good coffee.  I have found that the simpler methods (i.e., French press, AeroPress, pour over) are the easiest to control and therefore give you the best chance of getting a good result.  They are also cheaper and easier to keep clean.  Brewing good coffee is actually pretty straightforward so don't give up!</p>

When the first stream of a new brew cycle hits the bottom of the pot, boils off very quickly, producing a horrible smell and taste that infuses the entire pot. </p>

<p>In addition to the water boiling off, the various organic compounds in the coffee are subjected to temperatures well above the boiling point of water for a brief time, until the volume of new coffee cools the bottom of the pot enough to stop the boiling. Knowledgable staff know to leave a little clear water in the bottom of the pot to prevent the temperature from getting too high before the next pot is brewed.</p>

1679,2,,2015-03-27T21:47:34.720,7,,"<p>It depends on the method of brewing.  Brewing methods where grounds are exposed to a heat source directly (Turkish, for example) could allow the grounds to be heated to the point that they started to roast/cook/burn (again).  Most methods of brewing, however, only have the grounds exposed to boiling or near boiling water which is ~210F and less than would be necessary to start cooking/roasting/burning the coffee beans again.  </p>

<p>Many of these other answers actually talk about burning or cooking down stored coffee after it has been brewed.  </p>

<p>As to your question about large chains, my person belief is that the burnt taste most people experience is a branding issue.  Lightly roasted or medium roasted coffee will taste more like the bean it came from, or its origin.  The darker you roast, the more the origin flavors go away and are replaced by the roasting flavors of the bean.  As it so happens, the origin flavors of roasted coffee fade very quickly (sometimes in as short as a week).  However, the roasting flavors seem to hang around a bit longer.  Large chains dark roast their coffee because it makes it easier to consistently produce close to the same taste and the flavor of those dark roasted bean will hang around a bit longer (less shipping and storage concerns).  </p>

<p>In truth, coffee has no ""strength"" until it is brewed. And then, strength is determined by how many solubles you have dissolved into the water. If you want stronger coffee, use more grounds per measure of water. Over-extracting the coffee will make it stronger, but it will also make it more bitter and less pleasant at the same time. (If you're interested, <a href=""https://eatlikeadinosaur.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/how-coffee-brewing-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> is a more detailed explanation of this).</p>

1685,2,,2015-03-30T18:17:56.477,5,,"<p>Brew method doesn't make any difference in caffeine content.</p>

<p>Caffeine generally extracts very quickly from the grounds... as fast or faster than the acids, so you will have most of it in your cup regardless of brew method.  Continuing to over-extract the coffee isn't going to yield any more caffeine, either, at least not in any significant measure. I certainly wouldn't brew over-extracted coffee just in hopes of a little extra caffeine. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction#Extraction_yield"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>)</p>

<p>Darkness of the roast does affect caffeine content in way, because it affects the weight of each bean as it roasts. If you measure your grounds by weight (as you should), dark roasts have more caffeine. Though if you measure by volume (as is more common), then light roasts will have more (<a href=""http://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-dark-vs-light"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>). So, for more caffeine, favor dark roasts, but be sure you measure your coffee by weight, not volume, if you're comparing to light roasts.</p>

<p>Some people talk about whether espresso or drip coffee has more caffeine. The problem with this is it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. A cup of coffee has more caffeine than a shot of espresso... but of course it does, it's eight fluid ounces of coffee compared to one fluid ounce of espresso. And if you were to compare equal volumes, the espresso has far more... because it uses about eight grams of beans per ounce where drip coffee is around two and a half.</p>

<p>Which, in a roundabout way, gets to the point: the best thing you can do, if you want more caffeine, is brew it stronger, using any method. And by that, I mean use more grounds.</p>

Part of the roasting process is some sort of agitation and airflow to remove this chaff.  Depending on the roast level and other mechanical factors, more or less of the silverskin may be removed.  On lighter roasted coffee with less expansion you can often see bits of silverskin along the seam on the bean.  Some processing methods prior to roasting also remove less of the silverskin, ""dry processed"" coffee in particular tends to be more chaffy when roasting and may require a longer time agitating or smaller roast batches to remove chaff.  </p>

<p>I'd also keep in mind that coffee has a cooling period after you ""stop"" roasting, where it will generally still roast to a darker level (or two). You need to try to finish your roast at a level or so lighter than what you are aiming for and let the coffee ""cool"" into your desired roast.</p>

<p>I might suggest that you roast at a lower level (lower heat) so that the beans move through the stages more slowly.  This will badly suck up your time, but will also allow you greater chance of stopping the roast at the roast level you are aiming for.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that many of the descriptions you read for green coffee are done by people with extremely refined palates.  No matter what coffee you roast, those fruit type descriptions are still hints and notes in the coffee, not it's overall flavor.  Additionally the quality of the green beans you are roasting will affect the final quality of your roast. It's impossible to make poor green beans great by perfectly roasting them.  You can, however, ruin high quality green beans with a poor roast.  </p>

<p>When I started roasting, I was ""lucky"" enough to start with a cheap air popper.  The advantage of that is that with a popper it is very easy to hear the ""cracks"" associated with roasting.  My personal opinion is that the ""cracks"" are one of the few constants with beans that actually consistently indicate roast level. While there are other gauges out there (darkness and smell), they can vary with different varieties of beans.  Eventually I moved to a machine where I couldn't hear the cracking at all, but by then, I had learned enough of the other cues that it didn't matter as much.</p>

You may try throwing some additional grind on your coffee, or buy pre-ground coffee that is more finely ground (although a snob such as myself would never actually advise buying pre-ground coffee).</p>

1708,2,,2015-04-03T23:55:41.033,4,,"<p>Actually the answer will be completely dependent on the coffee you're using, how finely it's ground, and how dark it's roasted.  I read on a roaster's site (I'll try to find the reference) that acidic flavors come out first, sweet compounds second, and bitter flavors last when brewing.  The trick is to stop the extraction before you get the bitter flavors.  Hotter water and finer grounds will extract faster.  Darker roasts will tend to be more harshly flavored than lighter roasts and a fine ground dark bean with very hot water might be undrinkable.  </p>

<p>I would definitely experiment with your coffee.  200F water is a bit on the hot side, 190-195 is a more common recommendation.  With that temperature, start with 30 seconds, next try 1 minute and so on until you find the ""sweet spot"" so to speak.  There will definitely be a difference in the taste.  The World Aeropress Championships site is a good start but modifying their methods to suit your taste is easy with an AeroPress.  I see you're already using the inverted method which will very definitely allow you to vary the timing.  Good luck!</p>

1710,2,,2015-04-06T13:05:47.043,1,,"<p>As Keith and Chris note - a darker (as in the darkest you can get) roast and boiling water is going to lead to a (in time, with experimentation, <em>pleasant</em>) over-extraction. Something else you can do is add a pinch of sea / kosher salt to the grinds prior to pouring in the water.</p>

<p>This will <em>not</em> make your coffee salty, it will simply bring out the natural bitterness of the extra compounds the over-extraction will produce. You can use a pinch of salt if you want to back off the temperature of the water, or how dark the roast is, in order to achieve basically the same effect as you would with either.</p>

</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQFsH.jpg"" alt=""removable mesh filter basket""></p>

<p>The support of the basket protects against failures. And while you won't be able to rinse the reverse side easily, you will be able to get enough water into it to saturate through the paper. (Those flakes you mention will be trapped between the reverse of the filter and the basket.)</p>

<p>Hot versus Cold? I'd use warm. Some things you're removing may be more soluble at higher temperatures. I wouldn't go to the trouble of heating pre-filtered water. there is something to be said for water temperature affecting the filtering qualities of the paper by expanding the fibers, and in turn spaces between fibers. But without testing we'll have to assume it's a minor. If you only have cold filtered water, I suggest you use that. </p>

<p>Why not hot water? First, a quick rinse of hot water isn't going to neutralize significantly more micro organisms that cold. You need boiling or much higher for a length of time to do that. Second, hot water will make the filter more prone to breaking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference</p>

<p>This leads me to think that soaking is worth a try. If it works for rice to remove excess starch, it might work similarly with paper</p>

<hr>

<p>A slightly different angle on this: </p>

<p>Try to find the filters that don't need rinsing. When I filter I'm doing so to reduce the cholesterol raising impact of coffee. I prefer the taste of unfiltered coffee, but the evidence convinces me that filtered coffee is better for my cholesterol.</p>

<p>The study linked below, amongst others, shows that paper filters remove much of the cholesterol-raising compounds, as much as ""80% of the lipid-solublue substance that was present..."" Pre-wetting the paper --pre-loading the fibers with water, really-- seem as though it would reduce this absorbent property, although I can't back that up.</p>

This answer addresses some of the product design challenges and less of the real engineering challenges, but a lead into the engineering challenges. Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker.</p>

<p>From a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing. </p>

<p>Assumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$) </p>

<p><strong>Coffee Maker Product Landscape</strong><br>
Based on the above I did some research on <a href=""http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">food services warehouse</a> and selected Grindmaster for this analysis. Base on list price following are the price point classification (Dollars $)</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP: 1000 - 2600</li>
<li>MPP: 3500 - 4700</li>
<li>HPP: 6000 - 10,000</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a table for OPP, MPP, and HPP price segmentation (April 6th, 2015)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zRxCvm.jpg"" alt=""Price segmentation""></a></p>

<p>Lets assume the following as customer segments</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP: Small office break room coffee machine</li>
<li>MPP: Large office cafeteria</li>
<li>HPP: High traffic coffee shop, Panera, Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts…</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Requirements Analysis:</strong><br>
Flow rate was chosen to keep the analysis simple</p>

<ul>
<li>OPP:  4 - 15 gl/hr</li>
<li>MPP: 15 - 32 gl/hr</li>
<li>HPP:  32 - 50 gl/hr</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Engineering Analysis</strong></p>

<p><strong>Product Design</strong><br>
Consider the Motor (Rotor, Stator, Casting) or the heating element from the BOM. Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLImtm.jpg"" alt=""Example BOM for  coffee Maker""></a></p>

<p><strong>Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing</strong><br>
The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products.</p>

<p><strong>Product Serviceability and Support</strong><br>
An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.  </p>

<p>Product Pricing VS BOM price -> General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation. </p>

Espresso is a very specific brewing method that produces a very specific type of coffee.  Trying to mimic that flavor profile with other brew methods will generally fall short.  Using more coffee for stronger flavor is one option, but it ends up not being cost effective in the long run.  More extraction is an option, but over extracted coffee often has a flavor profile associated with it that isn't desirable as well. </p>

<p>The closest you can get (in my opinion) on a budget is probably an Aeropress.  It is fairly inexpensive and makes a very strong cup of coffee using a reasonable amount of grounds that isn't espresso, but also isn't over extracted.

Would that be the same as the keep warm period and thus be fine, or would it cause the heating element to behave differently and possibly burn the coffee or cause a fire hazard?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

1730,2,,2015-04-11T03:52:22.493,7,,"<p>It is important to have in mind that altitude is not the only feature that allows one to differentiate the coffee beans. Temperature is perhaps even more important (altitude influences in the temperatures suffered by a coffee plant, but not all the same altitudes mean the same temperature profiles).</p>

<p>As a brief summary (taken from <sup>[1]</sup>), we can say that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower elevations (Robusta species) mean a more intensely coffee flavoured bean (more caffeine).</li>
<li>Higher elevations (Arabica species) mean more acid and complex taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the main factor is the species of coffee. The elevation and temperature only tell you what of the varieties of these species you can successfully grow and how you can harvest it.</p>

<hr>

<p>According to this source <sup>[2]</sup>: <a href=""http://www.scribblerscoffee.com/flavor_effect_of_altitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Effect of Altitude on Coffee Flavor</a>, that relates only to the Arabica species, can be summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Altitude contributes to a coffee taste profile.</li>
<li>Ideal growing conditions for the coffee tree:

<ul>
<li>At the coffee belt (a band extending approximately 30° north and south of equator).</li>
<li>At high elevations, between 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) and 6,000 feet (1828,8 meters) and beyond.</li>
<li>These conditions provide a frost-free climate.</li>
<li>Averaging 60°F (15.56°C) to 70°F (21.11°C) year round.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cooler mountains provide a slower growth cycle for coffee tree.

<ul>
<li>This means deeper and more interesting flavours (due to a longer maturation process).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Better drainage of soils means less water in the fruit.

<ul>
<li>Further concentration of flavours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More fertile the soil, the better.

<ul>
<li>A volcanic soil is often preferred.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The farther we are from the coffee belt, the less elevation we must grow coffee tree in order to avoid low temperatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a more specific summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generally speaking, more elevation implies a more pronounced and distinctive flavour profile:

<ul>
<li>From the simple, mild and subtle of those grown at 2,000 feet (609,6 meters).</li>
<li>To a fruit, spice, floral profile for those grown at 5,000 feet (1524 meters) or above (when possible).</li>
</ul></li>

<p>In a moka pot, the downward spout of the funnel does not reach all the way to the bottom of the pot. Brewing will stop once the level of water in the pot falls below the bottom of the funnel (if you carry on brewing after this point, you'll be making coffee with the superheated steam, which will be burnt and bitter).</p>

<p>I'm not sure why this is how it works, but I guess it's to prevent the pot from boiling dry, and retaining a thermal mass in the bottom pot to help it cool down again.</p>

<p>My drip coffee machine doesn't allow you to switch it to one mode or the other, you just switch it on and it pumps the water through the filter until its empty - there is a floating switch in the bottom so it knows when there is no more water left, and the hot plate is always on.</p>

<p>I assume that your drip coffee machine works in the same way but has separate controls for the brew and keep warm features. Switching the 'keep warm' feature back on isn't going to harm anything - I'd question the quality of the coffee after 2+ hours sitting on a hot plate though. </p>

1740,2,,2015-04-15T14:53:20.007,3,,"<p>Several ""automatic pour-over"" machines have recently come onto the market from manufacturers such as those you listed.  They are something of a hybrid between the ubiquitous, conventional ""automatic drip"" machines and manual pour-over methods.  That is, the automatic pour-over machines attempt to perform the same sequence of steps recommended for manual pour-over, but in an automated fashion.</p>

<p>For example, compare the <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle pour-over drip guide</a>. This suggests a multi-step process of pouring. With water at a particular temperature, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>heat the cone and wet the filter;</li>
<li>pour a small amount of water to wet the grounds and ""bloom"", then wait;</li>
<li>pour the rest of the water slowly in the middle of the grounds pile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other guides recommend pouring in circular motions, or in multiple iterations, or at a particular rate, or in certain places.  See also the question about <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/339/pouring-technique-for-drip-pour-over-coffee"">pour-over techniques</a>.</p>

<p>Regular auto-drip machines, on the other hand, simply drop water in one go over all of the grounds in a somewhat uncontrolled manner.  This also relates to a question: does auto-drip taste different than pour-over? That's a separate, open question.</p>

<p>This article from LifeHacker gives <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/automatic-pour-overs-do-they-make-a-better-cup-of-coff-1583005950"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a comparison between the new-fangled automatic pour-over machines and how they compare to real, manual pour-over</a>, and another from <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/16/ottomatic-chemex-coffee-brewer_n_6329320.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HuffPo</a> about the Chemex model. Their conclusions are varied (see article for more) but:</p>

<ul>
<li>they're more expensive than conventional drip;</li>
<li>some models have controllable settings for certain parameters (e.g., bloom time; temperature)</li>
<li>they provide precise repeatability for certain parameters such as rate, contact time with grounds, water temperature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, they provide attention to detail that can be done by hand; some do this better than others. However, most just heat water and drip it over the grounds somewhat better than a conventional drip coffee maker.</p>

<p>If you...</p>

<ul>
<li>don't want to learn the ""style"" or ""art"" to manual pour-over, or </li>

<p>For fast, automatic laziness -- yielding a quick, easy cup of passable coffee -- you can't beat pod-based automatic machines. Fill the pitcher with water, insert pod, press button... done. The only thing to mess up could be forgetting to place a coffee cup below the spigot. Clean-up is practically non-existent. I personally find the quality of this coffee to be low and unsatisfying.</p>

<p>Otherwise, streamline your French Press routine:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start your water boiling. Go about other business for a few minutes (or stare at the wall if other business is impossible before coffee).</li>
<li>When the water has boiled, grind your coffee and put it in your сafetière (French Press). Add water; submerge coffee. Wait.</li>
<li>Press and drink.</li>
<li>Begin clean-up: dump grounds into compost and allow to dry on its own (a few hours).</li>
<li>Shake out dried coffee and rinse; repeat as necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>Commentary: </p>

<ul>
<li>This permits really only 3 steps of brewing: boil, mix, press. This is about as simple as possible. By grinding after boiling, this minimizes the amount of time between grind and brew (crucial minutes!) and minimizes the overhead of manual interaction.</li>
<li>By using the multi-step clean-up process that I describe, this maximizes efficiency: get most of the coffee out by shaking when still wet (just brewed). Allow to dry on its own, and the rest of the coffee grounds will come out easily. A simple rinse is enough to get most of the remnants out without clogging a sink drain.</li>

1742,2,,2015-04-15T19:08:46.567,4,,"<p>Blooming is the outgassing of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the ground coffee in response to hot water being added.  The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.  </p>

<p>First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.  </p>

<p>Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.  </p>

<p>I tend to brew coffee one cup at a time. To avoid waste, I only brew as much as I need, so I usually drink it all.  In order to further reduce waste, I have tried metallic net filters instead of paper filters, but they tend to allow an ultra fine silt to pass through, the presence of which at the bottom of the cup is annoying if the plan is to drink all the coffee.  So, I started doing this: first I place a paper filter in the coffee maker, to collect the ultra fine silt, which is actually very small in volume, and inside the paper filter I place the metallic net filter to collect the actual coffee grounds, which are 99% of the volume. Then, I brew my coffee.  When it is time to make more coffee, I only remove and wash the metallic net filter; the paper filter stays in its place, and gets reused about five times before it has collected so much ultra-fine silt that it is time to replace it.  </p>

<p>Now, the question.</p>

<p>Do you see anything seriously wrong with this technique?  Does it perhaps have any side effects that I should be aware of?  Would such a practice be considered yucky by some?  (If it is, then this is a cultural issue that perhaps I should be aware of.)  Obviously, the coffee smells and tastes fine to me, but I have to wonder whether noses and palates that are more sensitive than mine think otherwise.</p>

<p>To create <em>instant coffee</em> granules, the manufacturer first brews the coffee using conventional methods and then either freeze-dries or spray-dries the coffee to create a soluble powder form. Dried coffee.</p>

<p>The amount of caffeine in the instant coffee will depend largely the original brewing process. Since commercial instant coffee is created in very large volumes, they are likely extracting coffee faster than our meticulous home-brewed methods. So while caffeine is water soluble, it takes <em>more</em> time for the caffeine to be extracted and absorbed in the water than other compounds. And ""more time"" is <strong><em>not</em></strong> something that the mass-produced instant process allows. Less extraction time = less caffeine.</p>

1757,2,,2015-04-17T19:18:08.403,7,,"<p>Over the years I developed a caffeine addiction that reached fairly severe levels.  For background, the addiction ramped into high gear the summer after my freshman year of college (summer of '99) when I was consuming somewhere between 60 and 100 ounces of coffee per day.  I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad.</p>

<p>Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I <strong>slowly</strong> backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.  I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am.</p>

<p>I did all this over a six-week period.  That kept the headaches away, and decreased my dependence on the drug.  However, I had to maintain at that level for several more months -- probably about six or so -- for my sensitivity to caffeine to go back up.  Now, when I drink a cup in the morning, it has the desired effect: it perks me up and prepares me for my day.  It's no longer a crutch, it's simply a pick-me-up I enjoy.</p>

<p>In summary: back down your caffeine intake, whatever the delivery method you prefer, by 10 to 20 percent each week until you reach a more manageable level, then hold at that level for several months.  That will increase your sensitivity.</p>

1758,2,,2015-04-17T19:28:48.770,4,,"<p>Brewed coffee ages like milk.  As soon as it is brewed its flavor begins to degrade and deteriorate, which is why it always tastes much better freshly brewed.  While you may not necessarily taste the difference from one pot to the next, it has definitely changed your overall expectation of the flavor.  The bouquet of coffee also is very complex, as is obvious from the fact that there is a distinct change in the scent from the time you grind to the time the brewing stops.</p>

<p>One flavor issue with reusing paper filters is that they tend to stop a large amount of the oils in the coffee from making it into the final product.  This could be desirable, as many (myself included) prefer the taste of paper-filtered coffee that does not contain the compounds found in the crema (the thin layer of foam on top of espresso, Turkish or French-press coffee).  These, which are often a combination of both sweet and bitter, are trapped by paper filters, but they will break down in the paper over multiple uses and wash into your coffee anyway, but not necessarily in the same form, which further changes the flavor profile.</p>

<p>If waste is a major concern, but you prefer paper-filtered coffee, you can make a compromise and use an Aeropress.  These use filters that are only about 2 inches in total diameter, meaning less gets tossed with each brew.  You could also look into filters made with recycled paper.  It won't reduce the waste, but it will reduce the environmental impact somewhat.</p>

<p>Remember, though, that in the end paper filters are biodegradable and, if thrown away along with the grounds, can actually aid in creation of compost -- a good thing.</p>

1759,2,,2015-04-17T20:07:48.837,16,,"<p>In general, I argue that <strong>you <em>shouldn't be able to</em> re-use the grounds.</strong> That is, for any brewing session, your goal is to extract exactly what you want from the beans. If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds. </p>

<p>That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests <strong>you might want to change other parameters of your brewing</strong>. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1564/what-do-the-terms-extraction-and-strength-mean"">this Q/A for what I mean by extraction</a> in this case.</p>

<p>You could <strong>try this experimentally</strong> also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :)</p>

<p>As a practical note, you might also consider simply to <strong>brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go</strong>. You'll get a slightly different product but, for example, I find that I use way less grounds for a 10-cup thermal carafe than for 10 individual cups.</p>

  <p> No success, strength did not increase and taste just got worse.</p>

<p><strong>What I did:</strong> 
I took my strongest beans, ground them as fine as possible, used two identical cups, divided the grounds into two equal portions (on a separate tray). I put grounds first, boiling water afterwards in the first cup, and did the same thing but backwards on the second one. I did not stir any of the cups after adding all ingredients. After quite some time I tasted both cups, I am now finishing them both up while programming.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong>
The grounds on the ""water-first"" cup took a considerable time to sink into the liquid. Even after the brewing time had passed, much more grounds were floating around there than in the ""pour-over"" cup. Also, the water-first cup had almost no foam, which the pour-over cup had plenty of.</p>

<p><strong>Results:</strong>
The water-first cup was <strong>not</strong> stronger than the pour-over; if anything it tasted weaker. The taste was quite different too, water-first tasted a bit stale/watery (not much but there was a clear difference). Pour-over had a rounder and more full aroma, liked that one more. And the crema/foam <em>looked</em> a lot better on the pour-over as well.</p>

Water flowing through coffee will follow the path of least resistance, so when you have gaps being formed by CO2 bubbles, some water is going to quickly and disproportionately rush through those low density areas. Degassing as much as possible with a minimal amount of water mitigates the detrimental effects of channeling and allows the coffee to return to a more uniform density before proper brewing begins.</p>

<p>Obviously channeling is not an issue with immersion methods like French press, Aeropress, Clever, etc., so you're unlikely to see as dramatic a difference.</p>

1768,2,,2015-04-21T16:30:27.790,4,,"<p>There are a few things you can do.</p>

<p>1) More beans.  More beans = more surface area = more extraction.</p>

<p>2) Grind finer.  It's tough to control grind size with a blade grinder, so if you really want a consistent, strong cup, you will eventually want to invest in a burr grinder.  But with a blade grinder, grind it longer.</p>

<p>3) This is the biggest: <em>don't use boiling water</em>. Optimal coffee extraction occurs at temperatures roughly between 185 and 202 degrees F.  You'll need to play with this, because the actual best temperature varies with things like water quality, altitude and, yes, weather.  Those last two are the same reason why recipes often have special steps or settings for high-altitude prep.  I find that, in North Carolina, the best temperature is on the higher end of that range, from 195 to 200 degrees.</p>

<p>4) Finally, don't stir with a metal spoon during extraction.  Metal is a heat sink and will alter the temperature of the water.  Additionally (this is speculation, as I don't have verification for this), the fact that many coffees are at least mildly acidic can also result in flavor changes with a metal spoon if you stir before adding cream.  The cream is basic and will help neutralize the acid.</p>

<p>Now, there may be more to the story. Indonesians I know have offered two explanations for why I was unimpressed. And these excuses were not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>One is a lack of certification -- that is, how do you know you were drinking real Kopi Luwak? Hah! Maybe somebody's faking you out!</p>

<p>The other excuse is that, even when it's ""real"", it might be factory farmed. This excuse is based on the observation (true) that Kopi Luwak used to be produced entirely from excreta by Luwak in the wild, who (according to this story) would eat only the best coffee cherries, often from the best coffee estates. These days, lamentably, most Kopi Luwak is produced by shoveling lots of possibly-mediocre coffee cherries into Luwak pens, then raking up what they crap out. Between (1) the stressed condition of these captive animals, (2) a coffee-cherry-only diet (not very balanced), (3) the lower quality of the coffee they are fed, and perhaps (4) slipshod processing by opportunists who don't really know coffee, Kopi Luwak coffee quality has taken a dive.</p>

<p>Or so /that/ excuse goes.</p>

<p>I was suprised to find that Kopi Luwak in Indonesia is not really dramatically more expensive. Maybe 30% more than anything comparable, when I was there last year. That margin might be narrowing. The cachet of Kopi Luwak being ""the world's rarest coffee"" apparently become a selling point in Indonesia, but since the barriers to market entry are low (especially since verification is virtually non-existent), Indonesia is probably approaching an oversupply situation.</p>

<p>At best, if you can identify Real Kopi Luwak, there might be something slightly more appealing about it compared to beans from the same estate that were not, erm, ""processed"" by some wild Luwak ""cherry-picking"" the best beans. More likely, though, no matter what you try, it will just taste how it tasted to me wherever I went: like something pooped out of some poor animal that was suffering from a serious caffeine addiction.</p>

1782,2,,2015-04-25T06:31:43.593,11,,"<p>I've had this <em>on the farm where it was harvested</em>, and was able to verify for myself that wild, happy civets were left to their own selection process and merely followed around by farmers eager to find the drops.</p>
<p>It's not unlike any other Arabica bean. What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it <em>correctly</em> don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it:</p>
<h3>The Roast</h3>
<p>Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people <em>and</em> to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it <em>just at</em> the second 'crack'. A comparable color is a Starbucks 'blonde' roast, or the usual color of illy in the red can.</p>
<h3>The Brew</h3>
<p>I've had it two ways, as espresso and in a press. I <em>prefer</em> to have it in a press, despite not getting nearly as much crema. A coarse grind, hot clean water and about 4 minutes to brew. <em><strong>Drink it immediately with a clean palette</strong></em>. Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down.</p>
<h3>The Taste</h3>
<p>While debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process <em>does</em>. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are <em>very</em> picky cats.</p>
<p>But, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes <em>very</em> close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak).</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Don't raise your expectations <em>too</em> high, it's not really <em>that</em> much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience.</p>
<p>It tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day.</p>

1791,2,,2015-04-29T15:34:26.427,4,,"<p><strong>Edit 02/26/2016.</strong> I am now convinced that resting the beans is necessary. There are just two many roasters I've heard from (on here and in person) that believe it is necessary, and I have seen with my own eyes changes in the appearance of the beans a day after the roast (they seem to darken a bit).</p>

<p><strong>Previously (while still unconvinced).</strong>
John Snow's and Nathan's answers sound very plausible, but I'm still not convinced that resting fresh-roasted coffee (past the point of cooling) improves its brewed taste. As far as I can tell, no one has ever proven this. DISCLAIMER - I don't <em>want</em> to believe it, because I think brewing after roasting is fun. But I will eventually listen to reason if strong enough arguments present themselves. Below are a couple of points that allow me to remain in disbelief.</p>

<p>There's a guy on YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYyVGuluuaU"" rel=""nofollow"">claiming the resting fresh-roasted coffee principle is a myth</a> due to a mistaken case of cause and effect from unskilled coffee shop employees. He goes so far as to tell his own myth of a teenage kid (suffering from acne - nice touch) who sees his employer resting the beans and makes the conclusion that they're better after they sit. But really, the employer is letting the coffee rest because it's impossible to brew large amounts of really fresh roasted (it will explode or something) and the teen is just too lazy to ask. He just wants to smoke weed.</p>

<p>Now if you're not convinced by the explanation above, the only scholarly source I could find is Michael Sivetz's <em>Coffee Processing Technology</em>, Volume 1, where on <a href=""http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002932617;view=1up;seq=268"" rel=""nofollow"">page 248</a> he writes, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beans cannot be ground directly after roasting as they are too soft and would be crushed, flattened, and scarred. When the beans are cool, hard, and brittle, they may be ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I just have to cool them down? Ok, I may be extrapolating a bit since this book is about getting coffee to the masses. And it's very old.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm not a scientist, but I just don't see how carbon dioxide escaping from a bean is going to change the flavor of brewed coffee, especially considering the bean is about to be pulverized and soaked in near boiling water. </p>

Obviously the whole point of tamping is to compress the grounds consistently throughout the whole puck, so this would achieve this the best. If you want to use a flat tamper for any reason in this situation, you would be best using a 57mm flat tamper and tap the edge of the portafilter to knock any loose grounds back down into the basket and then rotate the tamper over to produce a flat surface for the water to pass through.</p>

Also, if you look into hangover literature, e.g. <a href=""http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cdar/2010/00000003/00000002/art00007"" rel=""nofollow"">Treatment and Prevention of Alcohol Hangover</a> (you should be able to get it for free if you search on google scholar), coffee is rarely even investigated as a possible treatment method.  </p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<p>3 cups water</p>

<p>3 tablespoons ground coffee from Emirates</p>

<p>1 tablespoon ground cardamon</p>

<p>5 to 6 cloves</p>

<p>1 finger tip saffron threads</p>

<p>1 teaspoon rosewater</p>

<p>Method:</p>

<p>Boil water in frying pan. Add coffee. Cover and boil for 10 minutes. Add cardamon and cloves and boil for three more minutes. Remove from stove and let it cool for one minute without stirring. Put rose water and saffron into a thermos bottle. Add coffee via a sieve. Wait 5 minutes. Then the coffee will be ready to drink.</p>

If you have taken ground coffee and sugar- then the next step would be to add little amount of room temperature water. Don't add to less that you see a hard glob and don't add too much that it becomes runny.
If you're adding decoction ,then skip adding the water.</p>

<p>Now,all you do is take a spoon and start beating the mixture in the cup-just like you would beat eggs for omelettes.
The color will lighten up- it goes from dark coffee brown to muddy brown.Also it attains the consistency of whipped cream but slightly fluid.
Then add hot milk. Stir with a spoon,the froth comes up and voila you have your frothy coffee !!</p>

1821,2,,2015-05-03T16:10:42.093,8,,"<p>They aren't <em>just</em> frothing the milk, they're also <em>stretching</em> the milk. Stretching it is what gives a latte its unique texture (though the micro bubbles add to that). If you want a good latte, focus first on stretching it - you can use a small whisk to get air into the milk if need be.</p>

<p>You want a small stainless steel pitcher, most look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnlis.jpg"" alt=""pitcher""></p>

<p>Put 2/3 of the amount of <em>cold</em> milk you actually want in your latte in that, then put it on a heat source (small burner is okay). Hold your hand around the pitcher while it heats, and use the other hand to stir the milk. You can also use one hand and just swirl the milk around in the pitcher - do what feels comfortable, just keep the milk moving. </p>

<p>As soon as the pitcher becomes <em>just less</em> than too hot for your hand, pull it. Swirl it around a little bit and look inside. Does the milk have a kind of gloss to it similar to Elmer's glue (or any other paste you used in school)? If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly.</p>

<p>An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface.</p>

<p>At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online). </p>

<p>You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it. That's fine, it's going to make a tasty drink, but it might fall short of your expectations if you don't <em>stretch</em> the milk as well. The process is what makes the milk and the coffee fall in love and give birth to a latte.</p>

<p>The steam wand on espresso machines heats the milk <em>and</em> adds the air, giving you a lot more control over the process. However, this will work almost as well. </p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Don't ever let the milk get close to simmering. It'll burn very quickly. </li>
<li>Use the handle if you have to put the pitcher back on the heat (as naturally, you took it off because it was approaching too hot to hold)</li>
<li>You want to get the milk <em>in</em> the coffee as soon as possible once it has that gloss. Don't let it cool down too much while frothing (work fast)</li>
<li>It's going to take some practice</li>
</ul>

<p>Total for this would be about $15 for the stainless steel pitcher, $10 - $15 for the frother, so all total around 30 bucks. You could use a sauce pan, but it's <em>much</em> harder to gauge how hot the milk is if you do, and much harder to control when you pour. </p>

I learned my lesson and roasted outside on a hot plate, but after a while I decided to try it indoors again.</p>

<p>I just have a basic fan under a microwave, but I'm now at the point where if I roast 1/2 cup at a medium heat, and ensure that I pour the hot beans out while still under the fan (no taking it to the sink!) my apartment comes out relatively unscathed.</p>

<p>I've been trying to figure out why more people don't roast at home, and I have my suspicions that the oil and tar-laced fumes have almost everything to do with it. I'm curious to hear other ideas on the matter.</p>

<p>I make a long black by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pour 3/4 cup of hot water (right from the machine)</li>
<li>Wait 2 - 3 minutes</li>
<li>Pull a double shot into it, holding it <em>right</em> under the group to minimize splashing</li>
<li>Let sit for about 30 seconds, serve</li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast, I make an Americano by just pulling a double shot into a cup while also taking care to minimize splashing, then I serve it with a small steel or ceramic carafe of hot water (everyone likes a little more or a little less than everyone else).</p>

<p>In both instances, I heat the cup, and that's important because the crema will quickly break up on the walls of the cup if you don't. Most good espresso machines allow you to heat cups on the top of them. </p>

<p>Now, my testing is somewhat limited because I drink good quality Arabica beans pretty much exclusively. Arabica has some subtle flavors and it's easy to tell when they're more pronounced. Long blacks <em>do</em> hit the caramel notes more, in my experience. But, I usually just make myself an Americano because it's easier and the taste isn't all <em>that</em> different. </p>

<p>Done at home using a <a href=""http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-barista-expresstm.html"">Breville Barista Express</a> in manual mode. You don't really need a super expensive machine to replicate this, you just need the ability to pre-infuse, warm the cup, and be able to wrangle one under the group to minimize splashing. </p>

<p>Concluding, I think there's some substance to this. However, I'm not sure how much it really matters to someone kind of fumbling around to get their first cup of the day. It took close to a dozen tries to finally get a process down where the taste was noticeable and I could reliably reproduce it. </p>

1832,2,,2015-05-05T11:59:24.033,8,,"<p>The most important distinction between blade and burr grinders is the result:</p>

<p><strong>Blade</strong></p>

<p>Coffee beans circulate across the spinning blades. No matter how long or short the grind, there is extreme heterogeneity in particle size--that is, you will find larger bean fragments with near-dust-size ones, with everything in between.  If you use a pour-over or drip brewing method, you might even see whole beans floating to the top. Not surprisingly, you'll get very uneven extraction from these different particles, no matter what the brewing method.</p>

<p>If you grind long enough to decimate all the beans, you'll find a lot of fine coffee dust and sediment in your cup. Too short a grind, and you get a lot of beans and bean pieces that can't present enough extractable surface area to the hot water, leading to a thin, weak cup. Waste of coffee, to be sure.</p>

<p>Also, it's almost impossible to grind any two batches consistently, since grind time is dependent on bean quantity, type of roast, variety of bean--well, <em>everything</em>.  So today you'll get a disappointing cup, and tomorrow you'll get another disappointing cup for some other reason. Therefore I recommend a <em>Conical Burr</em> grinder.</p>

<p><strong>Conical Burr</strong></p>

<p>Beans move through <strong>once</strong>.  When you set your burr grinder to a certain fineness, there will be very little heterogeneity in particle size.  (N.B.  Spend more on the grinder, get a more even grind.)  This allows you to experiment with the grind as well as the quantity until it's perfect for you, then replicate that recipe perfectly every time.</p>

<p>Some tips on finding the right burr grinder for your needs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prices vary from $50 to $1500 for non-commercial grinders.  I'm happy with my $350 Rancilio, which I've had for 10 years without a hint of trouble.</li>
<li>How you like your coffee matters.  A more expensive grinder will do better fine grinds, as for Arabic-style (i.e. Turkish, Greek, Lebanese) coffee.  If you don't drink that, don't spend more for it.  Most burr grinders perform best in the automatic drip range.</li>
<li>The under-$100 burr grinders still manage to throw a lot of fine coffee dust into the grind.  Do your research before buying.</li>
<li>Consistency in grind is critical to good espresso.  If this is important to you, be prepared to spend as much on the grinder as you spent on your espresso machine.  It's for a good cause.  Why hobble your good machine with sub-par ingredients?</li>

<p>In short, yes, all of these main types coffee makers use a different type or size of filter. Sometimes each type can use a different filter. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of filter types for these coffee makers which you have listed. Although the list in non-exhaustive, it will provide the main types of filters for each device.</p>

<h2>Understanding Permanent versus Paper filters</h2>

<p>A permanent filter is often made out of metal and is, in most cases, a mesh (not true for espresso machines). They are not disposable and are made to be reused many times.</p>

<p>An impermanent filter is generally made out of paper and is disposable and is generally not meant to be reused.</p>

<h2>Drip Coffee</h2>

<p>Drip Coffee machines are one of the most common coffee machines for home use. The filter used will either be paper or permanent.</p>

<p>A paper filter for the drip coffee machine will either be flat-bottom or cone-shaped depending on the make and model of the coffee machine.</p>

<p><strong>Flat-bottom filters:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIiwu.jpg"" alt=""Flat-bottom Filter""></p>

<p><strong>Cone shaped filter:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ntWce.jpg"" alt=""Cone shaped filter""></p>

<p>The permanent filter can take the same shapes, however it is generally a flat-bottom shape yet can be a hybrid between a cone shaped and a flat-bottom shaped filter. I can only describe this as an upside down triangular prism. Below is a picture of the aforementioned hybrid filter.</p>

<h2>Single Cup</h2>

<p>These filters are generally made out of paper and are usually a cone shape which is usually specific/unique to the type of single cup brewing device.</p>

<h2>French (Push) Press</h2>

<p>A french or push uses a permanent filter which is made out of a fine metal mesh. It is on the bottom of the plunger. The entire bottom of the filter has three main parts, shown below.</p>

<h2>Espresso Machine</h2>

<p>An espresso machine's filter is called a portafilter. It shaped like a small basket, made out of metal, and has small holes in the metal on the bottom. There are three sizes. The most common are the single and double shot filters and a rarer one is the triple shot filter. They increase in size to hold more ground coffee.</p>

<p>There are generally three types of portafilters in circulation with mainstream home espresso machines.</p>

<ol>
<li>Single wall. This is the most common in the industrial setting. It is contains only one wall on the bottom of the filter.</li>
<li>Double wall. Think about this as a portafilter for the inexperienced and is most common for the home espresso machine. It has a secondary wall on the bottom of the portafilter with only a few holes in it. The presence of two walls helps to regulate extraction pressure and is therefore good for those who are not very good at tamping pressure and grind size.</li>
<li>Pod filter. This is simply a specially designed filter that is the same shape as the others and comes with some home espresso machines. They are used to hold pre-made and pre-packaged espresso pods that one simply drops into the filter and can avoid many of the other steps of traditional espresso brewing such as tamping and grinding.</li>

In the case of Starbucks they are shipping so much of their coffee to so many locations and creating so much coffee at once that it may be easier to create consistency. The darker you roast the less the flavor of the original bean matters, so it may also be used as a method to roast cheaper or lower quality beans.</p>

<h2>When NOT to clean your Moka pot</h2>

<p>In daily use, do not use soap and water to clean the pot. This is because oils from the coffee will build up in the pot and contribute to the flavour of the coffee for each concurrent use. Just rinse with warm water, let it dry, and put it away.</p>

<h2>When to clean your Moka pot</h2>

<p>If you don't use your Moka pot daily, these oils will build up but become rancid over time. If you don't use your pot daily, it's a good idea to give it a scrub with soap and water every now and again.</p>

<h2>When to DESCALE your Moka pot</h2>

<p><strong>It seems that your Moka pot may have some hard mineral deposits, called scaling, inside the pot.</strong> There are multiple ways to descale a coffee machine. You can use a vinegar solution, lemon juice solution, or you can even buy coffee descaler from some supermarkets.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe for lemon juice and vinegar solutions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>50 warm water, 50 percent vinegar. (Do not inhale any fumes)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>OR</strong></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>25 percent lemon juice, 75 percent warm water. (Safer and more pleasant)</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice: Don't boil these solutions as the fumes can cause damage to your eyes and respiratory tract.</p>

<h2>When to consider throwing out your Moka pot</h2>

<p>If your flavour is still affected after you descale it, you may be dealing with some rust. If you happen to notice any rust inside or your coffee just has a strange taste after some amount of time and many brews, you may need to consider getting a new one.</p>

But using double filter since it also filter the ""flavor"", making it stale (you may lose the pleasant acidic, fruity flavor, or other unique flavor your bean may offered) and double filter can make your coffee over extracted thus unpleasant bitter flavor. 
If you want your coffee strong you may want other experiment</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use fresh coffee bean</strong>
the older the coffee, they tend to lose their flavor. The fresher, the better. You have to store your bean properly too, keep it in air-tight container, avoid direct sunlight</li>
<li><strong>wait  to grind your bean, until the last minute</strong> coffee lose a bit of its flavor after grinding. Ground coffee is also more sensitive to the moisture</li>
<li><p><strong>Use different kind of bean</strong> You may use robusta, it naturally has more ""caffeine"" compared to Arabica, therefore can ""hit"" you harder</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use different kind of roasting profile</strong> the darker the roast, the bitter it is, but it has less caffeine.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>when brewing</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-warming the equipment or insulating it</strong> basically the hotter the temperature you get bitter flavor, to avoid the ""upleasant bitter"" you may adjust the water temperature according to your preferences. Temperature loss often occurs as a result of heat absorption by the equipment itself (and therefore stale flavor), so pre-heat the equipment would prevent it</li>
<li><strong>Use finer grind</strong> Coarser grind can make your coffee under extracted</li>
<li><strong>Adjust the amount of your coffee</strong></li>
<li><strong>Adjust the steeping time</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In the end it comes down to your preference(s). No single technique is right for everyone. Enjoy your coffee immediately after brewing</p>

Most drug databases have listed pharmacokinetics for caffeine.  Onset is listed as 15 to 45 minutes with peak concentrations as 30 minutes in adults.  Half life for caffeine varies based on a number of factors.  For adults it is listed as 4 to 5 hours, however, studies suggest it is generally less for smokers.  It is much much longer for infants (52 to 96 hours) but generally by nine months of age, those numbers have dropped to similar levels seen in adults.  </p>

<p><strong>How you store the coffee will determine how long it keeps</strong>.
To improve storage look into bottling it in individual bottles with little headspace, or even kegging the coffee. Exposing coffee to oxygen will negatively impact flavor and expose coffee to more bacteria. Creating a concentrate of the coffee may help to prevent bacteria from forming. Splitting batches up into multiple sterile containers and keeping them sealed may also help it to last longer. </p>

<ul>
<li>It has the acidity of regular coffee, often making it harsh(er) to drink, cold brewing can reduce this acidity by 70% but also potentially leave some of the flavor a behind in the coffee</li>
<li>It will be diluted since the ice will melt leaving you with a weaker tasting drink. Often this is compensated for by doubling the strength of the hot brew and letting the ice dilute to normal strength</li>
<li>Supposedly (although I've never tried it), the Japanese iced coffee method is a middle ground between iced and cold brewed coffees. In this method, hot coffee is brewed directly over ice instantly cooling it locking in the full flavor of hot coffee, but oxidizing much less. </li>

<p>The other reason I prefer ceramic is for cleaning purposes. The ceramic is nonporous and I've used mine for 6 months with no residue or stains whatsoever. The plastic can form build ups from minerals in water or coffee and start to appear visually unappealing (not sure if it will affect flavor of coffee)</p>

<p>The plastic V60 is obviously more durable and resistant to bumps and minor drops, so it can be a portable solution for coffee. However the ceramic V60 is the most visually appealing of the V60's (in my opinion) and it stays at my home on the counter so I prefer it. I believe the grooves inside the brewer and the size of everything is identical, so you can't go wrong with any of them. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Unfiltered coffee is a significant source of cafestol and kahweol, which are diterpenes that have been implicated in the
  cholesterolraising effects of coffee. The results of epidemiological
  research suggest that coffee consumption may help prevent several
  chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s
  disease and liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma).
  Most prospective cohort studies have not found coffee consumption to
  be associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease
  risk. However, coffee consumption is associated with increases in
  several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure
  and plasma homocysteine. At present, there is little evidence that
  coffee consumption increases the risk of cancer. For adults consuming
  moderate amounts of coffee (3–4 cups/d providing 300–400 mg/d of
  caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence
  of health benefits. However, some groups, including people with
  hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly, may be more
  vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine. In addition, currently
  available evidence suggests that it may be prudent for pregnant women
  to limit coffee consumption to 3 cups/d providing no more than 300
  mg/d of caffeine to exclude any increased probability of spontaneous
  abortion or impaired fetal growth.</em></p>

1882,2,,2015-05-29T11:39:46.333,5,,"<p>Due to the age and usage of your Keurig machine, I would say that you are experiencing two possible problems - one at a time or perhaps both.</p>

<p><strong>The Problems:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The motor in the pump in your Keurig machine may simply just be getting worn out. If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups).</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><strong><em>CAUTION:</em></strong></h2>

<p>As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs). Do not breathe in the steam or fumes. </p>

<p>This is not a huge concern with lemon juice (which is why I recommend it), but if you were to use vinegar or a commercial de-scaler, this would be a huge concern. </p>

<p>Just be smart about it. You don't want to end up with permanent damage to your respiratory tract.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Other possible problems (harder to fix):</strong></p>

<p>It could be possible that a seal somewhere in the pump has worn out and air is entering the system as it is being pumped. This would involve replacing a seal and taking the machine apart though.</p>

<p>There may be some other component, that I can't think of, that is damaged. Try the above solutions and leave a comment. Let me know if anything works.</p>

1885,2,,2015-05-30T11:16:42.760,5,,"<p>I think there are 2 questions here. The first is why oil and water don't mix. The second is why oil rises, as opposed to sinking or staying in place. </p>

<p>First question. There is an old saying in chemistry that like dissolves like. What this means is that a substance tends to dissolve in another substance if the molecules of the 2 substances have similar electric dipole moments. Think of an electric dipole like you think of a magnet. The magnet has a north and south pole, and south end of one magnet is attracted to the north end of another magnet, and vice versa. The electric dipole has a positively charged end and a negatively charged end. The magnitude of the positive charge can be greater than that of the negative charge, or vice versa. The difference between the magnitudes of the 2 charges and the distance between them determines the moment or strength of the dipole. In general, dipoles with similar strengths dissolve in each other more readily than dipoles with very different strengths. Oil (as in hydrocarbon-based oils) and water have very different dipole moments, so oil and water do not readily dissolve in each other. </p>

<p>The second part of the answer has to do with a force called the buoyancy force. This is the force that causes some objects to float in water. Suppose you want to dissolve 1 cubic cm of oil in water. For this to happen, the oil has to displace 1 cubic cm of water. The buoyancy force on the oil is equal to the weight of that 1 cubic cm of water. Oil is less dense than water, so 1 cubic cm of oil weighs less than 1 cubic cm of water. Therefore, the upward buoyancy force on the oil, which is equal to the weight of water displaced, is greater than the downward force of gravity on the oil, also known as the weight of the oil. This inequality of forces causes the oil to rise in the water. If the oil were denser than the water, the oil's weight (the downward force) would exceed the buoyancy force (the upward force), and the oil would sink in the water.</p>

<p>OK, I know I should be using better materials etc., but bear with me.  This reminded me, not in a nice way, of long past attempts to get a second brew from filter coffee.</p>

<p>So is this just very poor quality raw materials roasted beyond the limit, or has the industry started to do something like extracting flavour for those capsules you see around and then roasting the heck out of the remaining grounds and selling them?

<p>You can pretty much expect that if you are buying ground coffee, it's going to be some degree of stale.  Coffee begins to stale minutes after being ground so it's rarely a wise idea to purchase ground coffee that has been sitting on a shelf an indeterminate amount of time. </p>

<p>As for the poor coffee from local shops, many <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1843/why-do-most-coffee-shops-use-such-dark-roast"">commercial roasting companies use a very dark roast</a> to ensure homogeneity of their product.

<p>You indicated that you will be using a drip machine with a paper filter.

There are some differences in caffeine levels, but a lot of contradictory information out there. I found a great explanation of why the caffeine levels can differ between roasts <a href=""https://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-dark-vs-light"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, but let me summarize from the post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you measure your coffee by scoops, light roasted coffee will have more caffeine. Since the beans are denser than a darker roast. However if you weigh out your scoops, darker roasts will have more caffeine, because there is less mass.</p>

<p>@ChrisAK is correct, the roasting process does not burn or destroy caffeine, but the level of roast will impact the weight of each bean.</p>

Is this uniform for any (reasonable) amount of coffee (say, 200mL-4L / 1 cup to 16 cups)? Or would I want, say, a higher ratio of grounds-to-coffee for making 2 cups, than for making 12 cups? I feel like I, personally, tend to use <em>more coffee</em> (per unit water) when making <em>fewer cups</em> (I'm not sure why; shorter extraction time? Matters of water retention? Mere personal preference?). </p>

<p>Surely this also depends on total extraction time and grind level, but perhaps that is a separate question. With due credit, this question was partly spurred from <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1894/optimizing-the-office-pot"">this recent question</a>.</p>

<p>The amount may vary with brewing method of course, since depending on the method, brew components (grounds, filter, other components) may retain various levels of water. </p>

<p>The one add on I will stipulate is that it is always better (for groups) to brew coffee that is too strong.  It is very easy to add some hot water to a cup and weaken a cup of coffee,  however, if you like strong coffee and it's been brewed weak, you are just out of luck.</p>

The time since roasting is important and, compounding on that, the time since grinding, thence finally how you brew it.</p>

<p>So your questions should be:</p>

<ol>
<li>What did I do different in the way I brewed this time?</li>
<li>How long since this coffee was roasted?</li>
<li>How long since this coffee was ground?</li>

<p>Even if the attendant cannot answer you it illustrates the fact that they don't know and you do care. Thence maybe one day you'll find a source where the attendant both knows and cares, so shop around.</p>

<p>Finally, there are different beans, different roasts, and different tastes. So, once all of the above is attended to, you may still, quite reasonably, conclude that the taste of that particular roasted bean is not for you. Again, exercise your options: go elsewhere, roast your own, etc.  </p>

<p>I would not categorically claim that a steady flow will give you a <em>better</em> shot, rather I'd say it gives you a more <em>consistent</em> shot; and consistency is highly desirable—if you can reproduce a shot consistently, then you can incrementally improve on it by tweaking one variable at a time.</p>

<p>Water pressure is a key variable in extracting the oils from the coffee, so if that variable is moving around during the extraction of a shot then you're going to get an inconsistent shot—it would be like mixing weak and strong shots and stirring them together.</p>

<p>If the flow rate is fluctuating then—I can't think what else it could be—unstable water pressure is the cause. Water pressure fluctuations could be the result of:</p>

<ul>
<li>the water pump is failing</li>
<li>the water supply is restricted</li>
<li>the (dry) puck is soaking (at the start of a shot the dry beans absorb moisture like a sponge so you won't see anything come out at first)</li>
<li>the (wet) puck is channelling (water has found a path through the puck with less resistance and—like a hole in a dam wall—is rushing through it)</li>
</ul>

<p>A variable rate of flow could get interesting if you have it under control and are experimenting with extraction techniques.  You might try to slow it down toward the end of the shot in order to get more oils out, but I think this just makes it bitter because you're actually reducing the pressure—so it is self-defeating.  Unless you have engineered a device which can detach pressure from flow rate... but now I'm dreaming... something like a camera shutter mechanism?</p>

<p>Also, Go with an extra tablespoon or two of coffee. As <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1904/101"">Chris In AK mentions</a> - it's easy to add water to strong coffee to weaken it a bit, but you can't do much with weak coffee if you like it stronger.

1908,2,,2015-06-08T11:10:54.150,1,,"<p>From the looks of the grinds, you were working with a blonde (lighter) roast, which is the <em>ideal</em> case for consistent grinds. Darker roasts are more prone to grinding unevenly on coarser settings (they're more brittle). I'd be more forgiving if that was the case, but it's not. It's conceivable that something was wrong with the grinder you purchased. It's normal to see some, but I don't think that many.</p>

<p>I suspect, if you remove the burr for cleaning / inspection, you'd see one or more knicks or small dents in one of the edges. They should be smooth and sharp, not jagged at all, or inconsistency becomes a big problem.</p>

<p>In my experience, burr grinders have a harder time with consistency in coarser grinds in general. The only one I've found that does it pretty consistently is the <a href=""http://www.brevilleusa.com/the-smart-grinder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Breville Smart Grinder</a>, which runs about $200. It's not <em>perfect</em>, but there aren't too many fines in the bottom of my cup when I brew a press, and it's also not the most expensive grinder I've tried. </p>

<p>If you really want no fines in your cup, you'd probably be better off going with an Aeropress - burr grinders that cost a thousand dollars or more will produce fines, especially with darker roasts. But if you're going with a grinder in that range, you're probably more interested in programmed auto-tamping for consistent shot extraction than anything. </p>

<p>I don't particularly care for blade grinders because it's hard to produce the same grind twice with them (issues of heat and such aside) until you really get to know them. After that and a mantra of <em>""pulse pulse two-Mississippi pulse pulse""</em> they can produce a relatively consistent coarse grind.</p>

<p>What you're essentially doing is heating the grinds, starting the extraction process a bit and then giving a <em>small</em> amount of hot water about 30 seconds to cool before adding more - very similar to what pre-infusing a puck in an espresso machine would accomplish.</p>

<p>Does it matter? It could conceivably affect taste, so yes. The extent that it might affect the flavor of the coffee would vary quite a bit depending on the beans, water and ground - but it will produce a difference in taste you can probably measure just by sampling in all but very dark roasts.</p>

<p>To your first question: If you want a stronger brew, why not <strong>simply use more coffee grounds</strong>? Your amount (21g grounds to 300g water+ice is about 14g/200mL cup) is already at the higher end of the spectrum for drip coffee; the industry standard is closer to 7g per cup/dose.

Acidity likely wouldn't be reduced by cooling the coffee directly after, it's possible that the melted ice is just diluting your brew and cooler temperature mellows out the taste of the acidity.</p>

<p>There are many ways of cold brewing. Some involve full immersion for a long extraction time, like Toddy. Others slowly drip cold water or ice melt into grounds using a <a href=""https://prima-coffee.com/equipment/yama/cdm-8"" rel=""nofollow"">drip tower</a>. The second method is often prefered and offers the most balanced extraction. However, I've had Toddy before and it does alright. Toddy might be the less expensive method, but for a plastic bin and some big paper filters I feel like a drip tower is better worth the money if you can find one for a reasonable price. You can find some drip tower/dutch coffee makers on ebay in the $90 range.</p>

<p>As far as I'm concerned, however, you are not cold brewing. You're just making iced coffee. I do something similar with an Aeropress. The Aeropress I would prefer for iced coffee, as it brews a concentrate. I've noticed little difference in acidity, it may seem more mild simply because it's cold and acids tend to mellow out at cooler temperatures, but once ingested its all the same(hot or cold) if you're trying to ward of acid reflux or similar. Cold brewing would actually make the coffee less acidic, rather than just mellowing out the taste of acidity.</p>

<p>If you're interested in trying the Aeropress method, I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy iced coffee. You press the aeropress directly over ice, and it melts the ice to form a perfect ratio of concentrate and water. Whereas most other methods are either diluted, or take time to cool. This method produces iced coffee in the same amount of time it takes to make a hot cup of coffee with the Aeropress(1-5min), without diluting the coffee. It accomplishes basically what you're intending to do, but with the aeropress rather than the chemex. This method will take less time, produce a stronger cup, and is a bit cheaper(the aeropress is pretty cheap). You can brew a cup when you want it, rather than prepping coffee ahead of time.</p>

Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well.</p>

<p>You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility).</p>

<p>I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom.</p>

<p>The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction.</p>

1922,2,,2015-06-12T23:00:34.080,4,,"<p>From what I can tell, you're grind is rather coarse for a pour-over. You should have a grind the size of kosher salt for most drippers. Perhaps its personal taste, and I cannot argue that. However, it's typically recommended you start with this grind size and adjust to your preference. As far as my own experience both working as a barista for a few years, and being a over all enthusiast, most grinders don't provide consistent grinds at a coarser settings.</p>

<p>People are right in saying that most home appliance grinders won't produce very consistent grinds. This is partially true. Your typical consumer grade grinder uses a conical burr, and conical burrs work great for finer grinds. I've had 3 different conical grinders, and I've used commercial conical grinders in the past. They all seem to produce fairly inconsistent grinds for coarser settings. However, they work great in espresso machines, which are generally grinding to a very fine grind. When using flat burr grinders I notice a much better consistency in grind at coarser settings. Many will say that the larger the burr and the slower the grind the better consistency you will have. However, I've never experimented with this myself, but I will say that flat burr grinders produce much better coarser grinds than conical burrs.</p>

<p>An example of a flat burr grinder is one that you would see at a grocery store or a coffee shop. They are generally very expensive, as they're generally fairly large and aimed at commercial use. That said the Baratza Virtuoso is a conical burr grinder, and it's probably good at what just about any conical burr grinder is good at, medium to fine grinds. I will say that one drawback with flat burr grinders is that they're very slow and create massive amounts of heat on fine grinds(espresso/turkish).</p>

<p>I'd say a conical burr is good for anything near the coarseness of salt and finer, anything beyond that would be best ground in a flat burr grinder. As far as a flat burr grinder, I feel its the size that matters. You'll want a larger disc for more consistency. Its my assumption that with a larger disc a slower speed will grind the coffee slower and more evenly, causing less of the grounds to crack and mash into finer particles while grinding.</p>

<p>Most of this is based off of my own observations, there are a few forums which concur with this, but in general there's not much else to support these claims. Maybe the flat burr grinders I used were simply higher quality than most of the conical burr grinders I've used.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to try a finer grind and see if you get better consistency then.</p>

<p>As far as a blade grinder goes, I'd say absolutely not. I doubt that a blade grinder would ever be more consistent than what you currently have. You can use a blade grinder 100 times and never come out with the same grind size, where as with a cheap burr grinder you'll alway have the same grind even if its not consistent. Even as far as consistency goes, a blade grinder won't achieve this either. I might(maybe..) recommend a blade grinder if you had an auto-dripper, where it wouldn't matter so much.</p>

<p>Try a finer grind, and let me know if the consistency gets any better.</p>

<p>Having found a good heat setting for the hob (that doesn't superheat the water instantly and boil it dry in ~20 seconds), I found that the hob attempts to maintain thermostatis by cycling the power on and off. This may work fine for a large pot of boiling water, but for the moka pot this means I get a few seconds of extraction, followed by a few seconds of water <em>being sucked back down the wrong way</em> as the pressure decreases, then forwards, then back, etc.</p>

<p>Aerpresso ends up somewhere in caffeine concentration between espresso (very concentrated) and drip coffee (less concentrated).  However, the total amount of caffeine is dependent more on the amount of grounds used that the extraction method (with the above listed methods). </p>

1933,2,,2015-06-18T15:54:55.763,8,,"<p>I've never heard of cheese and coffee pairings, but I've had coffee that has very wine like qualities. Personally this sounds like it would amount to gut rot, however if you try some lighter roasts or preferably profile roasted beans from areas in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, they tend to have very wine like qualities. Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean.</p>

<p>It might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called ""dutch coffee"", where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time.</p>

<p>As far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine &amp; cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee.</p>

<p>Cheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the ""dolce"" or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food.</p>

<p>I think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful. If she wants something to dip in her coffee, biscotti is a common choice, and if she wants cheese, try spreading some mascarpone on it. You can have fun with different biscotti variants and fold things like chocolate, fruits, etc into the mascarpone.</p>

1934,2,,2015-06-18T16:39:47.887,3,,"<p>As far as my experience with Moka pots, I don't have them on the stove for long. Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method.</p>
<p>As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot.</p>
<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
<p>Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove.</p>

1937,2,,2015-06-21T16:27:20.137,18,,"<p>Lots of questions! Starting from the top...</p>

<p><strong>Taste?</strong> Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a ""dried fruit"" taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/451/yemenite-tea-like-coffee""><em>cascara</em> (see this question/answers)</a>. The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage.</p>

<p><strong>Shipping?</strong> I've only seen <em>dried</em> coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps ""fresh"" coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions.</p>

<p><strong>Availability?</strong> Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the ""husks"") -- here's <a href=""http://www.vervecoffeeroasters.com/products/cascara-coffee-cherry-tea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one example from Verve</a>. Searching for coffee berries, cherries, husks, or for beverages like <em>cascara</em> or <em>qishr</em> may reveal more outlets.</p>

<p><strong>Other preservation?</strong> Coffee skins/pulp dry well. Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1508/what-variety-of-coffee-berries-are-good-for-jam"">this seminal question</a>, and also <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/54942/how-should-i-make-jam-out-of-coffee-cherries-or-coffee-cherry-husks"">a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice</a>. I'm sorry to report that I have not had much success yet. The dried cherries are tough, so not pleasant to eat outright.</p>

1939,2,,2015-06-21T18:39:24.113,11,,"<p>This answer addresses a &quot;standard&quot; semi-automatic espresso machine with a separate grinder. Specifically the LaMarzocco and Astoria grinder, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class.</p>
<h2>Cleaning</h2>
<p>Of course, wipe down everything and get all pitchers and spoons clean. Blast out all the milk and &quot;wetness&quot; from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with &quot;bumping&quot; so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean).</p>
<p>*especially <em>under</em> the basket.</p>
<h2>Calibrating</h2>
<p>The abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frob"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak</a>.</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6v8sh.png"" alt=""frob quote from Hackers' Dictionary"" /><br />
<a href=""http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html</a></p>
<p>To fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls.</p>
<ol>
<li>Frob. In the <em>frob</em> pass, we make just &quot;coarse&quot; adjustments to get everything roughly correct. (reinterpreting the hacker usage. This isn't <em>aimless</em>.)</li>
<li>Twiddle. In the <em>twiddle</em> pass, we adjust each parameter up and down a little, in a more &quot;scientific&quot; manner: while adjusting any one parameter, the rest are left alone so they behave as &quot;controls&quot; for the quick little &quot;experiments&quot; to check each change.</li>
<li>Tweak. In the <em>tweak</em> pass, everything should be mostly correct by now. Just apply any finishing touches.</li>
</ol>
<p>The controls we have available are the <strong>grind</strong>, <strong>dose</strong>, and <strong>water quantity</strong>. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be <em>constant</em>. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists.</p>
<p>In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting &quot;clicks&quot; of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to &quot;full&quot;, maybe a little heaping. This number is your <em>base</em> dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the &quot;frob&quot; of the dose.</p>
<p>Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the &quot;frob&quot; of the water quantity.</p>
<p>If the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the &quot;frob&quot; of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct.</p>
<p>So, we've done our &quot;frob&quot; pass. Now &quot;twiddle.&quot; Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to &quot;twiddle&quot; per se: there's no *up and down&quot; here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure.</p>
<p>Then do a &quot;twiddle&quot; of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its &quot;range&quot;, if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better.</p>
<p>There should be no need to &quot;twiddle&quot; the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot.</p>
<p>Now, one final pass to &quot;tweak&quot;. Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white &quot;overextraction stain&quot; where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop <em>just before</em> the color changes. This tweak gives you &quot;ristretto-quality&quot; shots.</p>
<h2>Adjusting on-the-fly</h2>
<p>Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is &quot;comfortable&quot;. This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to &quot;ride the wave&quot; of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling.</p>
<p>The same three adjustments, <strong>frob</strong>, <strong>twiddle</strong>, and <strong>tweak</strong>, apply also to dynamic adjustments. <strong>Frob</strong>, the <em>coarsest</em> control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. <strong>Twiddle</strong>, the <em>medium-grain</em> control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. <strong>Tweak</strong>, the <em>finest</em> control is the dose.</p>
<p>If a shot pulls 1-second too long, <strong>tweak</strong> your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster.</p>
<p>If a shot pulls 1-second too short, <strong>tweak</strong> your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower.</p>
<p>If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), <strong>twiddle</strong> the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same <em>density</em> with more <em>mass</em>.</p>
<p>If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), <strong>twiddle</strong> the grind a little finer so you can achieve the <em>density</em> with less <em>mass</em>. (Volume is constant.)</p>
<hr> 
<p>I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours.</p>
<p>On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs.</p>
<p>That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book.</p>

<p>Pull the grind back XX clicks coarser (XX=5 small recalib., XX=10 big recalib., XX=20 emergency (piston/powder errors -- but call service on it, too)).</p>

<p>Keep pulling pairs until it settles down to running <em>consistent</em> shots (howsoever fast). Check for dry pucks in the drawer.</p>

<p>Take it back up. Repeat: (Pull 1 pair of shots, Turn 1 click finer). Stop turning finer at 16 or 17 and it will ride up to 18-23s. (Mnemonic: ""<em><strong>blackjack house rules</strong></em>"".)</p>

<h2>Rinsing</h2>

<p>You should always be rinsing. You are not done rinsing until the water runs clear.</p>

<p>The water you see is the water you were about to brew with. Don't brew with brown water!</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>If the machine is acting up, give it a cleaning cycle. If a coworker challenges you, ask them why they want to serve bad shots??! Or better, calmly explain that it's the obvious thing to do to get back on track. Unpredictable shots == unpredictable drink production times. </p>

<p>If you cannot take the machine down for a cycle (it's too busy at that moment), the following should help, but is no substitute. </p>

<p>Super-automatics that have run hot all morning and then sat relatively idle through midmorning and then run hot again for the after-lunch crowd have what I call the ""oatmeal bowl problem"". If you eat some oatmeal and don't rinse the bowl right away, what happens? You know what happens! It gets hard. It becomes a crust. The same thing happens inside the machine. You need to run a cleaning cycle. For reals, dog.</p>

<p>Extending the analogy, suppose your friend drops by to borrow that book and you've had three bowl of oatmeal already and you offer your friend a bowl... You <em>wash</em> the bowl first ... right?</p>

<h2>Break it down.</h2>

<p>Step 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.<br>
Step 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.<br>
Step 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.  </p>

<p>I repeat:<br>
Step 1 of breaking down a machine is the pill.  </p>

<p>While it's <em>pilling</em>, you can soak the steam wand (<em>all the way up past the holes at the top, tube removed.</em>), and remove the hoppers and vacuum the grinders. </p>

<p>Wipe out the oils from the grinders with a napkin or paper towel (no water up there!)</p>

<p>When it's done pilling, you can take the drawer and the tray and the spout to wash.</p>

<p>Vacuum and/or wipe grounds from the <em>carcass</em> and reach up with a towel and clean the two <em>ribs</em>.</p>

<p>Then, clean the <em>heart</em>. Just between the ribs there are two circles, one on your side and one a few inches away on the other side. With a towel, wipe any crusty stuff from the edges of the two circles. These are the two halves which come together to form the brewing chamber, the <em>crucible</em> of the alchemy.</p>

<p>If you really want to treat your machine (maybe it's the machine's birthday), give it another pill before bringing it back up. Blast out the steam till it's nice and dry. Scrape and remove <em>all the milk residue</em> until its just shiny shiny metal. Bottle-brush the steam tube.</p>

<p>Then give its buddy some love.</p>

<h2>Calibrating.</h2>

<p>I'm assuming you don't have access to the real programming mode. So the controls here are very, very limited. You can adjust the grind, rinse, and pull shots with one of several programmed buttons. </p>

<p>Each programed button maintains a log of the parameters and measurements of the last few shots upon which it performs some simple statistical analysis to determine when to print ""adjust grind coarser"" or ""adjust grind finer"" on the screen. So, the machine only ""sees"" a problem when it becomes a big problem. And it's not designed to respond to (or even detect) ""too much inconsistency"". Conquently, always prefer the Log View which shows you the actual numbers to the standard view which only shows you the approximate extraction time averaged over the last several (about 5, I think) shots. On the Mastrena machine, switch to Log View by pressing the Up and Down buttons at the same time; switch back to normal view by pressing Cancel. (You can still queue shots but pressing Cancel to switch back to normal view will also remove the last queued shot just as it does on normal view.)</p>

<p>If the numbers are ""too inconsistent"" (exercise your judgment), then you really need to run a cleaning cycle before trying to calibrate.</p>

<p>Alright, to actually calibrate a programmed button on a clean machine, take the grind a few clicks <em>coarser</em> than you think it should be set. Coarser flakes will help to scrub the doser channels between the grinder and the brewing chamber. With a very fine grind, the heat and moisture from the nearby brewing chamber will contribute to <em>caking</em> in the doser. That gives you a non-linear response from grind-time-adjustment/extraction-time-result. And it is this which I believe is the cause of the usual ""death-spiral"" of a Super-Automatic before it needs servicing.</p>

<p>If it's acting <em>really bad</em>, you may need to go <em>more-than-a-few</em> clicks coarser. Following my own advice today took a lot longer than the official ""10 clicks coarser, pull 10 pairs, then adjust by pulling 3 pairs between each grind change"" that we currently follow (when I'm not around) probably would have done.</p>

<p>So, you've adjusted to a very coarse grind. Pull 3 or 4 (pairs of) shots, then start adjusting the grind finer 1 click at a time, then pull a shot. 1 click, 1 shot, 1 click, 1 shot. Then just follow house-rules for blackjack. Stand on 16 or 17. </p>

<p>It takes 2 or 3 pairs for a grind adjustment to take effect, depending upon the length of the doser channel in the particular kind of machine. So by the 1-click,1-shot cycle above, we have a 1 or 2 shot backlog of having adjusted finer. This will ride up to about 20sec shots if everything else is normal. So we stop adjusting when the shot times hit the bottom of the desired range.</p>

<h2>How to know if you've gone coarse enough</h2>

<p>The signs I've been looking for (which I kept not getting today) is a run of short shots at around 10sec that all look the same and leave the shot glasses mostly clear at the second rinse. I also look to see if its producing dry pucks in the drawer. If the puck explodes into mush, that's what we used to call a shot that <em>didn't ""catch""</em> on the old machines.</p>

<p>Run of short shots + clean at the second rinse + dry pucks == take it back up.</p>

<h2>Cross-Calibrating single-shot and double-shot programs at the same grind</h2>

<p>If you have single-shot and double-shot buttons which use the same grinder, then it's possible to have the singles pulling long with the doubles pulling short or any combination of good, bad, and ugly in between.</p>

<p>The procedure that seem to be working for me is to calibrate the longest program to be correct, and let the machine self-adjust the short program to compensate.</p>

<p>Always, always, always, calibrate from the <em>coarse</em> side of things. This keeps the doser and brewing chamber scrubbed and avoids caking which leads to unpredictable results.</p>

<h2>Adjusting on the fly</h2>

<p>I posted this idea some years ago in <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mjoshua.ryan/posts/229630143825012"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">facebook</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've begun to notice a pattern in the shot times on the Mastrenas.
   The first pair from a run are short, because the brewing chamber is
   relatively cold. As the chamber heats, grinds begin to accumulate
   on the interior, increasing the effective dose (therefore proportion,
   therefore density), progressively pulling longer and muddier shots.</p>
  
  <p>So, aside from rinsing like fanatics as you all already ought to do.
   You can:
   Before the first shot, click it finer.
   About 2 pairs into the run, click it back coarser.
   4 or 5 pairs after that, click it one more coarser. This is your
   ""cruise"" setting.</p>
  
  <p>Larger flakes should act more like ""fiber"" and keep the chamber scrubbed. But you need to go finer at the start to compensate for lower temperature.</p>
  
  <p>If it's been a long time (>15 minutes), then your first pair are not only
   cold but <em>stale</em>. If it's your mom, don't serve her those shots.</p>
  
  <p>Unlike the Verismos (and the Astorias, too, for that matter), these 
   Mastrenas seem to have a very small doser so the effect of grind-change 
   is quite rapid. This first pair will be a blend of the old setting and the new. 
   The second pair is most or all fresh ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Unresolved issues</h2>

<p><a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3430/untwist-the-triple-shot-program"">The triple shot button.</a> Right now on one machine we have the single part grinding longer than the double part, and I don't know how to get them untwisted.</p>

<h2>Piston/Position/Powder Errors</h2>

<p><strong>Call Service!</strong> But also, try this until they get there:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cross your fingers.</li>
<li>Pull a decaf single.</li>
<li>Rinse.</li>
<li>Throw a pinch of cinnamon over your shoulder.</li>
<li>Rinse again.</li>
<li>Pull a half-caff double.</li>
<li>Rinse again.</li>
<li>See ""Emergency recalib, above.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<em>n.b This is not official Starbucks policy, but my own private theory developed over the past 10 years of working with this machine (and its predecessor the Verismo). Other Starbucks Baristas should follow this advice only if comfortable with having to explain what you're doing to the other Baristas (and Managers) who may be staring at you wondering what you think you're doing.</em> </p>

1950,2,,2015-06-24T04:21:21.123,3,,"<h2>The Grind</h2>

<p>The goal for grinding coffee is consistency of the grind, everything should be relatively the same size so it extracts evenly. In coffee grinding parlance, ""boulders"" is used to describe chunks and ""fines"" is used to describe microfine particles. When you introduce water (in any extraction method), the ""fines"" give up their flavor quickly, adding bitterness when overextracted, and the boulders hardly give up anything at all, leaving a thin and sour underextracted flavor. </p>

<p>A burr grinder with two mounted bearings (top and bottom) is the best tool for consistent grinding due to the absence of ""burr wobble"" seen in cheaper burr grinders.</p>

<h2>The Resulting Brew</h2>

<p>A sediment layer comes from the fines making their way through the metal screen on the press. Ideally, your goal should be zero fines for your French Press brew. A coffee hack you can do to get around this is to shake your freshly ground coarse coffee in a small metal sieve so the fines fall through. Do this over a container to easily weigh the amount of fines your grinder is producing. I have also seen natural static as a useful by-product of grinding that prevents fines from exiting the grinder.</p>

1953,2,,2015-06-24T17:51:54.443,3,,"<p>There are two sides to the answer. First, there is the sugar aspect. In moderation, sugar is a critical part of our diet. If you are combining it with two doughnuts and two further teaspoons of sugar in the coffee (for example) then it could potentially lead to the same insulin cycle that causes weight gain in people who eat too much sugar.  The rapid intake of sugar causes your pancreas to flood your blood stream with insulin, which then drops your blood sugar lower than it should go. That causes cravings for more sugar.</p>

<p>The other side is how ""carmelized"" the sugar is. If it goes beyond a certain point, it's possible that the result could be carcinogenic, which is definitely bad.</p>

<li>A beverage originating in Yemen, probably from the literal translation <em>qahwa bayda</em>.

<p>On the topic of <strong>different beans in a burr grinder:</strong> I find that my (admittedly <em>cheap</em>) burr grinder ""chokes"" on darker-roast beans. When I put dark roast beans into the grinder, the chute gets clogged with coffee grounds more quickly (as compared to lighter-roasted beans). I have a timer-based auto-shutoff model, and much less grounds come out when the grinder is ""clogged"" in this way. I attribute this clogging to the oil on the surface of the beans that is somehow ""sticky"" and more prevalent on darker roast beans, but I'm not certain. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/forums/coffee/questions/318466"" rel=""noreferrer"">This article from Coffee Geek</a> talks about cleaning more frequently for darker roast beans, as does <a href=""https://www.seattlecoffeegear.com/learn/videos-home/ask-the-experts/burr-test-medium-dark-beans"" rel=""noreferrer"">this review from Seattle Coffee Gear</a>, as does <a href=""http://www.coffeereview.com/coffee-reference/from-crop-to-cup/grinding/burr-grinders/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one from Coffee Review</a>. </p>

<p>On the topic of <strong>espresso pulled from these grounds:</strong> This is tricky and I'm really just speculating. Perhaps it's a similar situation: your darker-roast beans respond to tamping differently than your lighter-roast beans. If you're tamping hard and the grounds are clumping together somehow, you might be getting some channeling (resulting in uneven extraction); this could cause a more ""watery"" shot. You might be able to see evidence of this in the puck after you pull the shot, or you might be able to see it while pulling the shot if you use a naked (bottomless) portafilter. <a href=""https://www.home-barista.com/espresso-guide-diagnose-extraction-problems.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">This article from Home-Barista</a> talks about a too-quick extraction being paired with grind flaws; are you seeing that?

<p>From my expierience with electronics, there are 3 ways how a low power mod could be done, depending on the details.</p>

<p>the first is to mod the power supply to the boiler (e.g. put an inductor in searies) and hope the machines software can cope with this.</p>

<p>second: If you do have to modify the software(and are able to, Replacing the controller  and reimplement the software may be required) you could implement a pwm regulation of the heating(your power line got to survive short overloads of ~0.1s)</p>

<p>third: The boiler has a to small heat capacity for a full cup and needs to draw full power during the pouring of coffe (my machine does this when it has to make a large cup). You have to change the boiler (bigger one might be to big for the case,) and then continue with one of the steps.</p>

<p>Note: If this can't be done in the fashion of “the nerd in the next cubicle does it for free coffe and no one ever is to talk about the mod” but you have to employ an external firm and need to match safety regulations you are almost definately cheaper off by upgrading the power supply to the office.</p>

But, I LOVE coffee and I LOVE the buzz caffeine provides. So, for the past couple of weeks I have remained disciplined in having caffeine every third day. My reasoning is based mostly on the fact that the first 48 hours of withdrawal is the worst part of it, so I thought that by waiting 72 hours, I could have my buzz a few times a week without developing a chemical dependency.</p>

<p>Does anyone have anything science-based that can further inform me as to whether my thinking is right on this?</p>

1992,2,,2015-07-06T00:18:49.580,1,,"<p>I'm not a pharmacologist, but I have done some research into this. AFAIUI all drugs have a measurable half-life in the body due to metabolism of the component chemicals. Broadly, there are water-soluble compounds which have a relatively short half-life (up to a few days), and insoluble compounds which typically have a much longer half-life.</p>

<p>The half-life (just like with radioisotopes) is the measure of the length of time for half of the compound to be eliminated. Depending upon the critical mass required to have an effect and the quantity consumed, it may take several periods of halving before the compound is <em>out of your system</em>.</p>

<p>If 72 hours gets you to where you don't feel the ""dependency"", it might be possible to reduce that by controlling your caffeine intake when you do drink coffee. You could try half-caff (IMO best to make your own blend, and don't skimp on the decaf part: Decaf should cost more because it costs money to decaffeinate the beans). </p>

<p>You could also try alternating with hot chocolate or a flavorful herbal tea (my latest fav is Yogi Teas Egyptian Licorice). A significant part may be the psychological aspect of the <em>ritual</em> of having a cup of hot coffee. Having a cup of hot <em>something</em> may just satisfy that need.</p>

2001,2,,2015-07-09T19:09:54.980,4,,"<p>I'm not exactly sure if this is accurate, but I think it has to do with flavor extraction. </p>

<p>When you brew with a filter, the water is going to fall through the grounds too fast to actually develop good flavor. Sure, you'll get coffee, but you're only giving the water enough time to take the more bitter tastes with it. I have this same problem with my coffee.</p>

<p>When you brew directly into water, all of the water is in contact with all of the grounds for a considerably longer amount of time. The water will extract the bitter tastes AND the more flavorful aspects of the grounds, which is why you thought this tasted better. It wasn't just bitter, it was bitter and flavorful, and that's coffee.</p>

<p>You're not doing anything wrong with the filtered methods, it's simply a matter of opinion among coffee tasters. Some people enjoy the convenience of fast, filtered, and bitter coffee because it's what they know as coffee. The reason the Turkish method isn't suggested is because, the way you describe it, it sounds like the grounds stay inside the coffee, and many people loathe having to deal with that--even though it produces much better coffee.</p>

<p>So no, you're not doing anything wrong; however, the reason you're finding flavor differences is that the extraction of flavors is far different between the two methods!</p>

My first attempts, following the instructions enclosed with the roaster turned out horribly, tasting both charred and grassy at the same time.  Yeechh.  After doing some online reading, I've greatly lengthened the roasting process with mostly good results.  I'm currently roasting batches of 90g of raw beans for between 12-17 minutes.  My thinking is that this is giving the beans time for the proper reactions to take place inside the beans without charring the outside.  But I've read that some commercial roasters might take 20 minutes or more to roast a batch.  Of course they are roasting much larger quantities than I am but it occurred to me that perhaps this longer roasting time is intentional and has some beneficial effect.</p>

<p>I'm mostly aiming for a City or City+ roast level and want to know if lengthening the roast time beyond what I'm currently doing is a good idea?

<p>It would also depend heavily on dosing. You would want to make sure that you don't try to compensate for your days off by going on a binge and placing yourself directly under the espresso maker until you've had 3 days worth!

<p>Drawing out the roast generally produces more even results.</p>

<p>Slower roasts mean that you have a better chance of stopping the roast at the target level and not over or under roasting.</p>

<p>You can search the online forums for some of the home roasting sites, but many people run their roasters at a higher setting, then turn down the heat once the roasting process is rolling.

<p>Personally I think there is a point of diminishing returns between the time dinkering with the roaster and the difference in the taste.  Most of my roasting lands in the 15 to 16 minute range and comes out even enough that I feel good about it.  I recommend drawing the time out just enough that the results are even enough for you and you are comfortably hitting your target roast level the vast majority of the time. </p>

Having used this method for many years now I think it gives consistently good coffee, comparable to that from a good espresso machine but without the need for machinery or paper filters.</p>

<p><strong>Recipe:</strong> Bring one cup's worth of water to a boil in a small pot. Add about a scoop and a half of ground decent-quality beans to the pot. Swirl gently until chalky bubbles appear. Filter through a tea strainer into a cup. Let stand briefly. </p>

<p>No need to grind the beans to a powder. The tea-strainer gets most of the grounds and the amount of sediment in the cup is about the same as in cafe espresso. The only electric component is a coffee grinder. Using pre-ground beans requires more coffee per cup, as some flavor will be missing.</p>

<p>In general this method produces coffee that is slightly weaker than espresso. While I might add a bit of sugar to espresso to counter bitterness if the beans are old or mediocre, the strainer method above gives coffee that is very drinkable without sugar. </p>

<p>His method is a bit different. He just pours the hot (even if it's still boiling) water into the filter. He briefly moistens the coffee and then lets the rest of the water pour into the filter until his water can is empty. He only pauses from pouring if it reaches the top of the filter. </p>

<p>I said that his method isn't good, as the water will flow faster through the filter and the coffee won't be as aromatic as it would be with my method.</p>

I press my areopress directly over ice, I've heard this reduces the acidity. Which would make sense, as acidity usually wards off mold. I leave all of my coffee black and unsweetened, so it is not dairy or added sugars that are causing this.</p>

<p>Perhaps try variating your brewing process. I'd be especially keen on the pH. Maybe there are some spores which will not grow in environments below a certain pH.</p>

<p>It is indented toward the middle of the funnel (i.e., not protruding out of the funnel). It's far too low to indicate recommended ""fill line"" for quantity of grounds (for my taste anyway!) There's no other attachment that fits into it, nor does it engage with any other part on the pot (e.g., the top lip of the funnel sits on the moka pot base). It's one piece of sheet metal; e.g., this isn't a point where two pieces attach. Some moka pots have funnels that have this crimp, and others are solid/flat around the side.</p>

2028,2,,2015-07-22T03:09:56.303,7,,"<p><strong>Short version:</strong> The Hario brand filters are <strong><em>thinner than other paper filters</em></strong> and seem to have <strong><em>more texture</em></strong> than other types of filters. I assume this has some, but perhaps slight, impact on the <strong><em>rate at which water passes through the filter</em></strong> and also <strong><em>what ""stuff"" passes through the filter</em></strong>, which impacts the resulting brew and its taste.</p>

<p><strong>Longer version:</strong> The rest of this response is basically a comparison of the Hario filters to other types of filters. This isn't particularly authoritative nor scientific. I don't immediately find any good online resources on this; one video that I don't care to link or watch, and another article from <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2011/11/best-ceramic-coffee-dripper-pourover-hario-bonmac-bee-house-kalita-reviews.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Serious Eats on dripper styles</a> but it doesn't compare the filters themselves as such. So, I'm going rogue.</p>

<p>The different cone (and filter) manufacturers each have their own shape, presumably to ensure product lock-in for consumables (in this case, primarily filters). Here are the three primary ones that I'm aware of:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NqO7d.jpg"" alt=""brown paper filters"">
Clockwise from upper left: off-brand Melitta-style #2, Hario brand V60 02, Chemex brand pre-folded bonded. All are ""natural"" brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties.</p>

<p>My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Chemex filter is very thick; almost more like like a thin pressed cotton cloth or fabric. Almost completely opaque. <a href=""http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/filters.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Chemex filter page</a> states that they are ""20-30% heavier"" than other filters and removes finer sediment and ""undesirable oils and fats"".</li>
<li>The Melitta-style is in the middle, and is similar in nature to most other Melitta-style and basket-style filter paper. Thick enough to be mostly opaque, but noticeably thinner than Chemex. The <a href=""http://www.melitta.com/en/2-Cone-Filter-Paper-Natural-Brown-40-Count-1428,64752.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Melitta brand filters</a> have claimed ""flavor enhancing perforations.""</li>
<li>The Hario brand is the thinnest by a fair margin. It's almost translucent through most of the filter, with a somewhat leaf-vein-like pattern to it, presumably from paper fibre and production method. This brown (""natural"") style seems to be called ""Misarashi"" for reasons I don't understand. There's little information on the Hario (<a href=""http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/v60-filter-papers.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.co.uk</a> / <a href=""http://www.hario.jp/product/list.php?middelclass=2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.jp</a>) pages about the nature of the filters.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly, I don't notice a significant difference in coffee draining rate (throughput), but I suspect there is. I (personally) think there's a slight difference in taste and output of the brew, but perhaps I'm fooling myself into legitimizing more coffee gear.</p>

<p>An extra benefit of foam &mdash; particularly <em>microfoam</em> where the bubbles are too small to see &mdash; is that it changes the surface tension of the liquid beverage, potentially allowing more taste-buds to come into surface contact.

2030,2,,2015-07-23T04:52:15.430,13,,"<p>You're highlighting two differences between the two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>temperature of the water, and</li>
<li>rate of pouring the water (equivalently, how ""full of water"" is the cone).</li>
</ul>

<p>Short story: Use water just off the boil (about 96°C / 205°F). I prefer your ""slower"" pour method over your friend's... read on for why.</p>

<p>Longer story:
Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/drip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle</a> and <a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/brew-guides/bee-house"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stumptown</a> and <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/make-better-pourover-coffee-how-pourover-works-temperature-timing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Serious Eats</a> and <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/howtouseapourover"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffee Geek</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Temperature.</strong> Most agree that water for pour-over should be <strong>just off the boil</strong>, but exact temperature is both difficult to <em>measure</em> and to <em>maintain</em>. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of <strong>93-97°C / 200-207°F</strong>. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the ""right stuff"" from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an ""off"" taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80°C / 175°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96°C / 205°F water.</p>

<p>With <em>my</em> technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, <em>I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure.</em> It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool.</p>

<p><strong>Rate of pouring the water.</strong> This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final ""drainage"" and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. <strong>I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the <em>output</em> at a steady rate.</strong> The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests).</p>

<p>All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring.</p>

2033,2,,2015-07-24T14:29:45.157,5,,"<p><strong>Yes, of course!</strong> As ""fancy"" coffee company <a href=""https://counterculturecoffee.com/learn/any-coffee-any-brew"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Counter Culture says: <em>Any Coffee, Any Brew</em></a>. In fact, even things that <em>aren't</em> actually coffee (barley, tea, herbs, etc.) could be brewed like coffee in an AeroPress or other coffee-brewing equipment.</p>

<p>But if fancy coffee is not your preference (or not practical, or not available, or whatever), try something different. And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or Nescafé or Eight O'Clock or Café du Monde or ...)?</p>

<p>In fact, a <strong>mass-market coffee like this might <em>benefit</em> from AeroPress treatment.</strong> For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of <strong><em>Robusta</em></strong> beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/barista/10-14-2006"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Robusta produces <strong>more crema</strong></a> in espresso, and might be a way to get <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/58/whats-the-most-effective-way-of-generating-crema-from-an-aeropress"">more crema from AeroPress</a>. Robusta also has slightly <strong>more caffeine</strong> than <em>Arabica</em>, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, <strong>you might reduce a bit of the bitterness</strong> sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup).</p>

<p><strong>There might be a few problems, though.</strong> First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like <strong>Maxwell House is rather course</strong> for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from <a href=""http://www.home-barista.com/grinders/can-ground-coffee-be-re-ground-t29153.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Home-Barista</a> and <a href=""http://www.bunn.com/dr-brew-blog/re-grinding-coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bunn</a>). Second, if there are other ""stuff"" in the coffee (e.g., ""Folgers Crystals"" or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip.</p>

<p>But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz.</p>

Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your ""mileage"" may vary.</p>

<p><strong>Another thing you'll want to check is that the rubber seal between the bottom and top parts is still in good shape</strong>, especially if this pot hasn't been used in a few decades. This is for reasons both practical (you need a tight seal for the vacuum to work well) and safety (you don't want the seal to come lose and spray boiling-hot water everywhere)!</p>

Reason being that their extraction times are so low that is usually not practical to press a fine grind coffee. Though this isn't a <em>direct</em> answer to your question, I'd recommend grinding your coffee directly before brewing. This is best practice, and it means you can grind your coffee to whichever coarseness that you need.</p>

<p>If you want to french press this coffee I think it would be best to adjust your extraction time. If you're using an espresso grind I'd do a short bloom, then extract for 45seconds. </p>

<p>To eliminate fine grit, wrap a paper coffee filter over the strainer, and press immediately to achieve 45second extraction, as there will be more resistance with the added filter. If the coffee is sour or bland increase extraction time. If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this. Using a fine grind will likely negate the benefits of using a press pot, and could very well be impossible/very difficult to consistently get a good cup.</p>

<p>Second drawback is that since the grounds remain in the pot in contact with the water, you have to empty the pot entirely once the coffee is ""done"".

<p>If you enjoy their beverages, then there probably isn't any reason you shouldn't continue to drink it.  I would guess you are in the minority of people buy what amounts to black coffee from Starbucks.  Starbucks is a fairly divisive brand among most consumers.  Most of the people I have talked to that like their beverages are buying mixed drinks from them and not straight espresso, drip coffee or americanos.  </p>

<p>Starbucks does sell organic, fair trade and the like specialty coffees as whole bean or ground.  However, the vast majority of their beverages sold daily is likely made with whatever their ""espresso"" blend is.  My personal opinion is that it's horrible and over roasted.   However, it's also consistently the same tasting and consumed on a fairly mass scale daily, so if there were any inherent dangers to it, we'd likely all be aware by now.</p>

<p>As a brand, Starbucks is mainly aimed at consistency.  In general, that's what fast food chains strive for as well, so in that respect, they are very similar.  Proper branding ensures that you can buy a product at any of hundreds of locations (or thousands) and it will taste the same.  However, many consumers prize quality and uniqueness over consistency.  In most industries (distilling, wine, food, beer) the most expensive and ""highest end products"" are items that were perhaps only produced at a limited run, or were very good in a particular year.  That mindset tends to be the antithesis of the mass produced ""good enough for everyone"" standards that huge market brands set for themselves.  </p>

<p>Coffee freshness is an extremely important variable when selecting coffee. There are roughly <a href=""http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/aromamain.htm"">800 volatile molecular components</a> found in coffee and much of it evaporates within several days of resting and/or minutes after grinding. A true coffee snob is very interested in a ""roast date"" rather than a ""best by date"" because it gives you a read on freshness rather than the fabricated ""expiration"" that the roaster arbitrarily puts on the bag. Imagine selecting bread at a bakery and they won't tell you the day it's baked, it is rather mind boggling!</p>

<p>Since starbucks is an international chain, coffee freshness does not become a economical priority when servicing thousands of stores and millions of customers. Roasted coffee sits in warehouses until it is finally delivered and used by the barista or bought off the shelf by the consumer. It appears that Starbucks shelf-life is 12 months according to their <a href=""http://globalassets.starbucks.com/assets/dcc4d0d527b14099a21cf664586bcfa1.pdf"">Standards for Food Suppliers</a>.</p>

<p>The core ingredients Starbucks uses are real ingredients. Coffee, milk, filtered water. Not all of the coffees are organic, but there are efforts underway throughout the world to reinvest in the farms and communities, etc etc. I'm sure there are specific priorities in each area, and going (California-certified) organic is not necessarily the highest. Education, clean water, economic concerns could each be more significant to a specific area (just speculating, and rationalizing; but it's all reasonable, right?).</p>

<p>Some stuff is more artificial. <del>The pumpkin sauce.</del> (They fixed the Pumpkin Sauce.) The whipping cream is a little thinned with skim milk and thickened back up with carrageenan. But the mocha sauce is just cocoa, sugar, vanillin, hot water + elbow grease.</p>

Easy right? What if I tell you they're indistinguishable in a lab? Still easy, right? What if I tell you the natural version is extracted from bugs? Yeah, insect extract. Now let's consider: natural or artificial? Still easy?</p>

<p>I'm not even sure which is in the pink cake pops at the moment. But, if you're getting something bright pink, how worried are you really? Is that wrong, to turn the whole question back?

<p>They are placed pretty evenly around the ridgy part toward the edge of the bottom of the circle, with a few toward the middle. They are only on the bottom of the pot as far as I can tell, not the sides. They look sort of like black mold, but I gave the pot a gentle scrub with warm water and a mild soap and they didn't budge.</p>

<p>I don't normally use soap on my pot. Generally I make a cup of coffee, rinse all components, and allow them to air dry. Sometimes when I'm pressed for time, the just-used pot sits in the sink for a few hours without getting disassembled or rinsed. I have a hunch that that moisture may be contributing here. I use filtered water, so I don't think they are mineral deposits (unlike in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1847/moka-pot-buildup"">this case</a>). The pot is pretty new.

2070,2,,2015-08-08T03:01:31.993,13,,"<p>Short story: <strong>They are probably aluminum oxide</strong>, but almost certainly some kind of metal oxide. <strong>You don't need to take any action unless they're affecting the taste of your coffee</strong>, and it shouldn't be. You probably <em>can't</em> (or <em>shouldn't</em>) really permanently remove them even if you wanted to.</p>

<p>Longer story...</p>

<p>This is a <a href=""http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">classic Bialetti</a> model, and a classic Bialetti symptom. The vessel is probably made out of alumin[i]um alloy (though there are similar models that are made of stainless steel, your picture seems to be looking down into the bottom heating vessel, and it looks like the classic aluminum species). Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic <em>failure</em> of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water.</p>

<p><strong>The vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and <em>dried thoroughly</em> in The Right Way.</strong> The <a href=""http://www.bialetti.com/coffee/stovetop/moka-express-c-1_7_22.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""care"" page for Bialetti</a> (follow that link, then click on the ""Care Use"" tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to <em>dry thoroughly</em> and most tellingly ""Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation."" Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation. </p>

<p>Standard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone. Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and <em>facilitates</em> further oxidation).</p>

<p>I have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and clean<em>able</em>) as the metaphorical ""whistle"".</p>

<p>For completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1849"">this answer</a> to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup (""scale"") from using ""hard"" water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this. However, I think it's unlikely that you'd see scale buildup over the span of a couple dozen uses.</p>

This is actually more of an Italian coffee since this is Italian itself. It is brewed by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>prepared by brewing espresso over hot water</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quote also from above link. So espresso is also in American coffee. Caffeine will vary as the <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/60/what-is-a-shot"">amount of shots</a> used will vary per person. </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Espresso</a> is coffee that is brewed by and is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has one of the most highest amount of caffeine of any other coffee drink per unit volume, so you would expect American and any type of coffee involving espresso will lots of caffeine. Well that depends on how much coffee you are drinking as espresso is served in smaller portions.</p>

<p>There's no such thing as Espresso Lungo, it's actually just called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lungo</a>. Another Italian coffee, this coffee is and is brewed by:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lungo is Italian for 'long', and refers to the coffee beverage made by using an espresso machine to make an Italian style coffee - short black with much more water, resulting in a stretched coffee, a lungo. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now don't be fooled by this as to make this coffee, you need an espresso machine
to make this creation. You just need more-than-normal amount of water and short black (single or double dose or shot). This coffee will have less caffeine than the above coffee types.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristretto"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ristretto</a> is more of the opposite of Lungo. It uses regular ground coffee with less-than-normal amount of water:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ristretto is traditionally a short shot of espresso coffee made with the normal amount of ground coffee but extracted with about half the amount of water...  The opposite of a ristretto is a lungo, which is typically double the shot volume. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also Italian and literally the opposite of a Lungo. It also has less caffeine than American or espresso since it only uses a short shot of espresso and regular ground coffee, similar to Lungo.</p>

<p>So, American and espresso have the highest caffeine content out of the four, and Lungo and Ristrtto have less caffeine than the above. I would say that espresso has the highest of all in fact but American still looks pretty high in caffeine too.</p>

  <p>Here is what I did:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>First</em>, make sure you have paper towels... seems foolish to mention, but hey... its true!
  
  <ul>
  <li>Approximate the size of your basket with your hand and tear a circle out of the paper towel bout an inch (+/- 2cm) wider than the basket size.</li>
  <li>Place the paper into the basket and push the center down to touch the bottom.</li>
  <li>the ""buckled"" edged should then be folded into an accordion (similar to the shape of a normal filter) -- this will help to maintain a ""wall"" for the water and grounds so they do not overflow into the drink.</li>
  <li>Place the coffee grounds into the basket in a normal fashion and brew.</li>

The terms for coffee varieties all contain an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis_%28linguistics%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">ellipsis</a>, effectively omitting the word <em>Caffè</em> (coffee):</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Espresso means ""expressed"", referring to the preparation method where water is pushed with high pressure through the grounds, as opposed to coffee from a <em>Caffettiera</em> or made by other methods. (Other sources claim it stands for ""explicitly"", meaning a cup that was prepared individually for every single guest or serving. ""espresso"" is the past participle of two italian verbs. Perhaps a happy coincidence.)</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Ristretto means ""restrained"". Easy to remember if one keeps in mind that in the old espresso machines water was pumped manually with a long lever - one lever ""pump"" resulting in one cup of espresso. If the movement was restrained: voilá, a ristretto.</p>

I'm interested in taking things a bit more seriously and would like to be a bit more meticulous when it comes to roast level.  I find that my popcorn popper (1200 W) roasts coffee a little too quickly, to the point that it becomes difficult to get a precise and consistent roast level from time to time.  Does anyone know of anyway that I could reduce the power of the roaster?  If it roasted at a lightly slower pace I feel like I would have better control over the process.  I've heard people suggest plugging it in through an extension cord or a power strip, which will reduce the power going to the popper.  Is there a more principled or controlled way of doing this?  Some sort of device that goes in between the popcorn popper plug and the outlet that would let me adjust the power at a fine granularity would be ideal.  Does this sort of technology exist?  Perhaps a sort of light switch dimmer would work?</p>

2095,2,,2015-08-26T17:38:28.457,11,,"<p>To say which of these has the <em>most</em> caffeine is a little bit complex, as it depends on if you mean how much caffeine per ounce vs. how much caffeine in the drink in its entirety. To start, let's explain the drinks.</p>

<p><strong>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#Brewing_process"" rel=""noreferrer"">Espresso</a></strong></p>

<p>Espresso is the key to this whole discussion. Each of the four beverages you referenced is (or contains) Espresso. Espresso is a method of brewing coffee, by which pressurized water is passed through a compacted ""puck"" of fine grounds. In a traditional espresso shot, roughly 0.25 oz of grounds are used to create about 0.85 oz of Espresso. Caffeine levels vary depending on the coffee beans, but as a mainstream reference, Espresso made by Starbucks contains <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/espresso"" rel=""noreferrer"">approximately 75mg</a> (they use slightly different measurements, however).</p>

<p><strong>2. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristretto"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ristretto</a></strong></p>

<p>Ristretto is a form of Espresso in which <em>less</em> water is used. So you take the same puck of 0.25 oz of finely ground coffee, but instead of making 0.9 oz of Espresso, you make a <em>more concentrated</em> 0.5 oz (or so). Because the strongest Espresso is the first to be brewed, this is <strong>the most concentrated form of espresso</strong>, and as such has the most caffeine <em>per ounce</em> of any drink on this list. That said, one shot of Ristretto is is less caffeinated than one shot of Espresso simply because there's less of it. As such, if measuring by the amount of caffeine per shot, this is the <em>least</em> caffeinated drink on this list.</p>

<p><strong>3. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lungo</a></strong></p>

<p>Lungo is the exact opposite of Ristretto. Instead of being an Espresso made with less water, it's an Espresso made with <em>twice</em> the water. As such, a single shot of Lungo has <strong>the most overall caffeine</strong> of any drink on this list, but is less concentrated than either standard Espresso or Ristretto.</p>

<p><strong>4. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Americano"" rel=""noreferrer"">Americano</a></strong></p>

<p>This is Espresso with water in it. No, really. A solo Americano has the exact same amount of caffeine as a solo Espresso, however it is watered down, and as such is the least concentrated drink on this list. You could hypothetically make an Americano from Ristretto or Lungo shots instead of standard Espresso, and in doing so make it less or more caffeinated (respectively).</p>

<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>

<p>Assuming all are made with the same number of shots, the most caffeinated drinks <em>overall</em> are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lungo</li>
<li>Espresso / Americano (tied)</li>
<li>Ristretto</li>
</ol>

<p>The most caffeinated drinks <em>per oz</em> are:</p>

<li>Ristretto</li>
<li>Espresso</li>
<li>Lungo</li>
<li>Americano</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before public sanitation, cholera and other water-transmitted diseases
  were a significant cause of death. Because the process of brewing any
  beer from malt involves mashing and boiling which effectively
  pasteurizes the wort, and the fermentation and hops protect against
  infection, drinking small beer instead of water was one way to escape
  infection. It was not uncommon for workers (including sailors) who
  engaged in heavy physical labor to drink more than 10 Imperial pints
  (5.7 liters) of small beer during a workday to slake their thirst.</p>

<p>To quote from an <a href=""http://gladwell.com/java-man/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> by Malcom Gladwell</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What this flood of caffeine did, according to Weinberg and Bealer, was to abet the process of industrialization–to help “large numbers of people to coordinate their work schedules by giving them the energy to start work at a given time and continue it as long as necessary.” Until the eighteenth century, it must be remembered, many Westerners drank beer almost continuously, even beginning their day with something called “beer soup.” (Bealer and Weinberg helpfully provide the following eighteenth-century German recipe: “Heat the beer in a saucepan; in a separate small pot beat a couple of eggs. Add a chunk of butter to the hot beer. Stir in some cool beer to cool it, then pour over the eggs. Add a bit of salt, and finally mix all the ingredients together, whisking it well to keep it from curdling.”) Now they began each day with a strong cup of coffee. One way to explain the industrial revolution is as the inevitable consequence of a world where people suddenly preferred being jittery to being drunk. In the modern world, there was no other way to keep up. That’s what Edison meant when he said that genius was ninety-nine per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. In the old paradigm, working with your mind had been associated with leisure. It was only the poor who worked hard. (The quintessential pre-industrial narrative of inspiration belonged to Archimedes, who made his discovery, let’s not forget, while taking a bath.) But Edison was saying that the old class distinctions no longer held true–that in the industrialized world there was as much toil associated with the life of the mind as there had once been with the travails of the body.</p>

2102,2,,2015-09-01T16:31:11.217,6,,"<p>Espresso tastes different than percolator coffee, but not necessarily better.  Espresso extraction produces a more concentrated drink with a different set of compounds that you would get with percolator extraction.  With a shorter extraction time and higher pressure, espresso will have a slightly different set of compounds than you would get from the same coffee with percolation.  </p>

<p>Some people prefer a more concentrated taste, however, some do not (many people think espresso is ""too strong"" when drank straight, thus the popularity here in the US of mixed espresso drinks).  This doesn't mean it's necessarily better.  Some types of beans are not well suited to espresso extraction and will actually produce a better cup when brewed with other methods.  </p>

<p>All coffee can be benefited or hindered by brew/prep method, but the quality of the bean and it's roast have quite a bit of influence in the matter.

2114,2,,2015-09-06T08:54:30.817,5,,"<p>Ground coffee is just the roasted coffee beans ground up to a fine powder. In order to make the beverage coffee, you need to combine this with hot water to extract the flavour (there are many different ways to do this). Typically, there is a filter that makes sure that the water can pass through the ground coffee but none of the ground ends up in your drink. </p>

<p>Instant coffee is dried brewed coffee - they grind up the coffee beans, brew the coffee and then remove the water.</p>

<p>A coffee machine or coffee maker is used for brewing coffee from ground coffee, not instant coffee. Instant coffee powder just needs to be rehydrated, so adding hot water is enough. It will completely dissolve in the water, which the ground in a coffee maker will not.</p>

<p>The machine you bought seems to be an espresso machine (it puts the water with high pressure through the ground coffee). This requires a relatively fine ground. Preground espresso will probably work, or you can also buy a grinder and grind the beans yourself. It also seems to have a pressurized filter basket, which means it will be quite forgiving and therefore easy to use.</p>

<p>I buy a Costa Rican Arabica roast from BJ's. I buy several pounds and stick it in the freezer. I grind before brewing. Have just bought a Breville Smart Grinder Pro and a Behmor Brazen Plus drip coffee maker (gold tone paperless filter). My grind size on the Breville is 48, the high end of medium according to their guide. However, I might be inclined to call it fine as pictures I've seen on the web lead me to this conclusion. Also, grinds tend to float in the air as I grind. As to the Brazen, I brew at 204 degrees with a 1.5 minute soak cycle. I use eight cups (setting) of grinds to make six cups of coffee.

2124,2,,2015-09-11T03:54:26.160,2,,"<p>In essence it's pressure, temperature and how coffee is generally ground for the method that make the difference. </p>

<p>Espresso forces water at high pressure (generally about 250PSI) and a specific temperature (generally between 92 and 94 degrees Celcius) through ground coffee. Percolator coffee relies on gravity to move water that's generally boiling (100 degrees) through coffee. The water temperature does make a significant difference because it is possible to burn coffee with water - which is one of the reasons that to many espresso drinkers filter coffee tastes burnt. </p>

<p>Grind makes a significant difference as well, Espresso coffee is generally ground finer than drip filter coffee which makes for a more intense taste for the volume of liquid. As per Chris' post, roast and been quality makes a difference - although I'd slightly disagree with Chris and say that it's more than a hindrance. The same bean ground for espresso and produced by an espresso machine and then ground for and produced by a drip filter will taste much different - and he's right in saying that it will highlight a really bad bean. It is also part of the skill of good baristas though that they know how to grind and extract almost any bean to get the best out of it, I know baristas who adjust for humidity though too so how far you can go is a guess for me.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Green beans.</strong> More people are getting into home roasting, and green (processed but un-roasted) beans are the vehicle. Also, green beans store better for longer time (e.g., freezing) so you can capture a particularly good ""year"" or crop of beans for a longer period of time. Even whole, unprocessed cherries might be an interesting notion. </li>
<li><strong>Skins and pulp.</strong> People make beverages out of the (usually discarded) fruit skin and pulp, called <em>cascara</em>, <em>qishr</em>, or other names. These are difficult to find dried, and perhaps impossible to find fresh.</li>
<li><strong>Direct marketing.</strong> Another trend is (broadly) the ""farm-to-table"" strategy, where roasters or cafes will purchase beans directly from farmers. There might be good business in brokering ""direct"" deals like this, by helping responsible farmers with good beans get good prices by selling directly to the end user (e.g., a local roaster) instead of through an aggregator or warehouse. You could seek out some exceptional beans with unique qualities and get those farmers into the specialty direct trade market. </li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The caffeine-withdrawal syndrome has been well characterized and there
  is sufficient empirical evidence to warrant inclusion of caffeine
  withdrawal as a disorder in the DSM and revision of diagnostic
  criteria in the ICD.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More explicitly (emphasis my own):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of 49 symptom categories identified, the following 10 fulfilled
  validity criteria: headache, fatigue, decreased energy/activeness,
  decreased alertness, drowsiness, decreased contentedness, depressed
  mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and foggy/not
  clearheaded. In addition, flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and
  muscle pain/stiffness were judged likely to represent valid symptom
  categories. In experimental studies, the incidence of headache was 50%
  and the incidence of clinically significant distress or functional
  impairment was 13%. Typically, onset of symptoms occurred 12–24 h
  after abstinence, with peak intensity at 20–51 h, and for a duration
  of 2–9 days. In general, the incidence or severity of symptoms
  increased with increases in daily dose; abstinence from <strong>doses as low
  as 100 mg/day produced symptoms</strong>. Research is reviewed indicating that
  expectancies are not a prime determinant of caffeine withdrawal and
  that avoidance of withdrawal symptoms plays a central role in habitual
  caffeine consumption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for health risks, beyond the symptoms of withdrawal, caffeine has been linked to a number of conditions, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895706102031552"">Aortic stiffness among hypertensions patients.</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/urinary-incontinence-oab/news/20100930/caffeine-and-bladder-problems-linked"">Incontinence among women</a></li>

<li><a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/3702680?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"">Cardiac Arrest</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So to summarize: Yes, you can be addicted to caffeine. No, it is not a myth. And it seems like you need as little as 100mg a day to be addicted, that is the equivalent of 1.5 espresso shots, according to <a href=""http://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/espresso"">this link.</a>. Prolonged caffeine use can be harmful, moderation is recommended.</p>

2129,2,,2015-09-14T18:42:37.970,2,,"<p>I'm a little surprised that you need to reduce temps on a 1200watt device. I had the opposite issue but similar techniques might help you. I looked at the system as having 3 basic variables: temperature, airflow, and volume of beans. Alter any one and you can achieve a different result. In my case I was unable to achieve high enough temps with my Air Crazy; particularly in cold weather since I roast outside. This is what I did:</p>

<p>1) Change the thermostat. I did it to increase temps but this is how I'd achieve a lower temp also. I switched the thermostat on my Air Crazy popper to increase the temp at which the element was turned off. If you pull it apart there is likely a thermostat on the chamber that opens the element circuit.  It should be marked in some way to indicate it's properties. Mine was riveted on. IIRC I bought a higher temp thermostat and also spaced it off the chamber a little. I used small stainless machine screws/nuts to reattach. </p>

<p>It's going to have 120v passing through it so make certain it is secure and the terminals are not contacting/energizing any other component like the actual roasting cup or popper case.  </p>

<p>If you do not have thermostat of some type in your element circuit (you almost certainly do) they are readily available online in a large range of temps. I believe mine opens at 210C now; I think it was 180c when I bought it. 210C is pretty hot and the whole popper gets rather hot but it works for me. You need one that resets, not a single use piece. </p>

<p>I think <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B008X0Y14A"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a> are what I used as I have 2 in my desk drawer right now.</p>

<p>In your case if you need to reduce the temps you may try thermal compound for CPU fans or a similar substance to increase conductivity and contact area at the thermostat, possibly turning off the element at a lower temp.  If not they clean up easily.</p>

<p>2)I altered the airflow also by closing some of the vents on the popping chamber, I've forgotten if I did this prior to upping the temps.  Same amount of air through fewer louvers resulted in higher velocities. Mine has louvers on the sides creating a swirling airflow to agitate the beans.</p>

<p>3)I added mass to the bottom of the popping chamber in an attempt to stabilize the overall temps. A few layers of heavy foil tape were enough.</p>

<p>4)I attached screens (actual window screen pieces) to intakes on bottom of it to stop the chaff from entering and burning on the element. I credit this for the 2 yr of usage I've gotten from this popper. Other elements have burnt open much faster. </p>

<p>5) I played with volume of beans to find max I could do without having uneven results. Too much and airflow was insufficient, too few beans seemed to greatly affect the quality. </p>

<p>In current practice I usually need to manually shake the popper every 20 sec or so up to first crack, from there the dried beans circulate well. I like very dark roasts so I also often restrict airflow somewhat later in the process by pressing the popper into a thick towel.  It is the easiest way I know to alter airflow (and thus temperature) on the fly. </p>

<p>This was several years ago so memory may be inaccurate. I'm not currently with the popper but can get it if you want more info or pics. I should buy another and better test these methods individually.</p>

2130,2,,2015-09-14T23:17:50.197,7,,"<p>The aeropress does not produce crema. There is no where near enough pressure using the aeropress to produce crema. Crema doesn't make coffee better, its typically a sign of good espresso, but isn't found in any other form of brewing nor is it what make the coffee actually taste better. French presses don't create crema either, and its a misleading yet common belief that they do.</p>

<p>The aeropress likely has about the same amount of oils as a pour-over cup of coffee if you're using the paper filters. The aeropress get it's richness from its style of brewing known as ""immersion brewing"". Longer contact with the grounds extracts compounds usually left behind by pour-over/drip methods. Combine with pressure, the aeropress, in short, just extracts more flavor by having a longer brew time and an environment which increases solubility with pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p>The AeroPress has a short ""brew time"", however what I was meaning to say is that the aeropress and other immersion brewers have a longer contact time of the bean and the water. Therefore you have more extraction. The aeropress, unlike any other immersion method uses pressure to increase solubility. It's known that if you increase pressure that you extract quicker, and your solvent(water in this case) is able to achieve higher saturation.</p>

It's probably best to use <strong>very finely ground, freshly ground</strong> cardamom seeds. You may even wish to <strong>grind the cardamom seeds along with your coffee</strong> (i.e., in the grinder at the same time); you'll get similarly-fine grind. However, you might get a bit of cardamom flavour left over in the grinder; this may (not) be desirable.</p>

<p>As another option, you could also consider <strong>a sprinkle of the dry, ground spice into the cup after brewing.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to cardamom or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_cardamom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">black cardamom</a>, one might also consider cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, anise, or other ""baking spices."" Any of these could be used in a similar way. For example, I sometimes use freshly grated nutmeg in the grounds when brewing pour-over, and it gives a nice smell and a hint of flavour in the cup.</p>

<p>You might also <strong>consider using an extract or essential oil</strong> or some high-intensity flavouring like that. You'd probably want to add that to your cup <em>after</em> brewing.</p>

<p><strong>I see a few problems that you might have to work around</strong>, specific to AeroPress, that you might run into with any of these spices. One problem you might encounter is the <em>rather short infusion time</em> commonly used in AeroPress; an option might be to try to <strong>steep the spice in the water as you're bringing it to the boil</strong>, but you risk burning the spice or otherwise contaminating the kettle (but might be worth a try to boil in a regular cooking pan). Another problem is that some spices have a rather strong hydrophobic tendency (specifically, cinnamon), so it might be necessary to stir the grounds more thoroughly than usual, to make sure the spices are infusing in the water. Also, these spices might leave behind some flavour in the AeroPress, so do consider washing thoroughly and soon after the brew. And you might get a hint of the spice next brew... so make sure it's something that you won't mind in the future!</p>

<p>When you go to brew the coffee, wet the grounds just enough so that there's hardly a drip through it. Let it sit for 30-60 seconds, then finish brewing.</p>

<p>To do this, I use a ceramic burr hand grinder (because I'm cheap) on one of the finest grind settings it will do. I use good whole bean coffee, and the cheap paper filters it came with. I heat water to around 175 degrees and only fill the water to just above the 1. I do wet the filter first and give it a little stir, but I only let it sit for a few seconds before pressing. I press <em>as hard as I can.</em> This goes against the Aerobie instructions but the more pressure, the more oils you get from the coffee grind (and the more tawny, creamy foam ends up on top). The very fine grind is critical here; you will not get the tawny foam from a coarse grind.</p>

<p>I find burr grinders generally produce a superior result in terms of <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/84/how-does-coffee-grind-consistency-affect-coffee-taste"">grind consistency</a>, less heat generated, and therefore final product is better. Sometimes in a pinch, however, I need to use a rotary grinder (e.g., it's the only grinder around; burr grinder hopper is full of other beans; flavoured beans that I don't want to pollute the burr grinder; testing to see if a newly roasted batch of beans is ""ready"", etc.) -- and there <em>are</em> <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1812/blade-grinders-any-advantage-over-burr-grinders-besides-cost"">some advantages of rotary grinders</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I'd like to use the rotary grinder in such a way as <em>to make the ground coffee particle size as even as possible.</em></strong> Is this even possible? I find that, no matter how I use the thing, I end up with some very large chunks (even whole beans) and some extremely fine powder. The result is only usable in filter coffee (drip/pour-over), but it simply doesn't ""work"" as well as when the ground coffee particle size is more even.</p>

<p>I have searched for techniques or recommendations, but I find exactly <em>nothing</em> helpful on this, but I believe there must be <em>some way</em> to optimize the use of a rotary grinder. I have tried things like...</p>

<ul>
<li>Pulsing the machine. Turning on for a second, then letting the blades come to rest, then pulsing some more, until I achieve approximately the grind I'm looking for;</li>
<li>Shaking the grinder up and down during the grinding;</li>
<li>Revolving the grinder around in a circle the opposite way that the blades are spinning;</li>
<li>Using more or less beans in a single grinding session (""half full"" seems to work best for me)</li>

2143,2,,2015-09-25T13:10:54.973,5,,"<p>""Using more or less beans in a single grinding session"" will yield the most bang for buck, usually.  However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides.</p>

<p>You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber.</p>

<p>Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).  Some fancy rotary grinders have timers and knobs and levers to set so you don't have to count to yourself before you let go of the grind-button.  That helps, but is far from a silver bullet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is difficult to arrive at a recommended ordinary consumption
  quantity, or a standard “dose,” since caffeine is present in various
  consumer goods at widely differing levels. Some sources suggest that
  one-hundred milligrams, whether delivered into the bloodstream by
  liquid or solid, is useful as a base-line single dosage.[18] Though
  caffeine content can differ markedly even within a product category,
  (for example, the amount of caffeine present in “real-world coffee”
  can range from seventy-five to two-hundred-fifty milligrams per
  serving), the rough quantity of caffeine in the most commonly ingested
  products is well known.[19]</p>
  
  <p>A standard six ounce cup of drip-brewed coffee contains roughly
  one-hundred milligrams of caffeine, whereas a similarly sized cup of
  brewed tea contains roughly seventy milligrams.[20] Espresso, a common
  ingredient in many of today’s popular specialty coffee drinks,
  contains closer to one-hundred milligrams of caffeine per liquid
  ounce.[21] A conventional twelve ounce can of soda contains
  approximately fifty milligrams of caffeine, though specialty sodas
  such as “Jolt Cola” contain closer to seventy milligrams.[22] Milk
  chocolate contains roughly six milligrams of caffeine per ounce.[23]
  In the most common over-the-counter drugs, “Anacin” and “Excedrin”
  tablets contain thirty-two milligrams of caffeine each, while
  “Vivarin” contains two-hundred milligrams per tablet.[24]</p>
  
  <p>More noteworthy than the specific quantity of caffeine in conventional
  consumer products is the quantity of each product ingested on a daily
  basis. While the customary six ounce cup of coffee may contain
  one-hundred milligrams of caffeine, the ordinary serving sizes of
  “Starbucks” coffees are twelve, sixteen, and twenty ounces each.[25]
  More than half of all adult Americans “drink an average of three and a
  half cups of coffee a day, in addition to tea, cola, chocolate and
  over-the-counter caffeine-containing drugs.”[26] If potential problems
  with adult caffeine consumption are an issue to be considered, the
  caffeine intake of children is even more important, because “the
  potency of caffeine on a human body depends on the body’s weight.”[27]
  Some sources suggest that “[t]he highest exposure to caffeine from
  soft drinks on a mg/ kg / day basis is among young children,”
  especially children under the age of six.[28]</p>

One needs approx. 15g coffee per 250ml water, corresponding to 115beans per cup.
A 237ml serving of coffee contains 95mg caffeine (USDA), which would be 830ug / bean (I've read other sources saying about 1mg/bean).

In your 145g bag, let's say 2/3 of the weight, e.g. 100g, is coffee beans, which corresponds to 770 beans, which would be 640mg to 5.2g(!) of caffeine.
<strong>However</strong> it's not clear how much extraction occurs the human digestion system at body temperature, especially as you will not chew the beans as finely as a coffee grinder.</p>

<ul>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Heat from grinding</li>
<li>Type and roast of the bean</li>
</ul>

<p>Grinders that produce almost no heat while grinding, to the point that they do it reliably enough for it to be a listed feature cost <em>ten times</em> the amount that you paid for your grinder. Heat during grind isn't an indication of a low-quality grinder, rather, little to no heat is simply an indicator of a <em>very</em> high-quality grinder. There isn't much you can do about this other than purchase a manual burr grinder and grind by hand <em>very</em> gingerly, which takes lots of time.</p>

<p>Tamping alone should be sufficient to deal with any clumps (at approximately 15kg of force) - if it's not, then you want to take a very close look at the beans you're using, and the level of humidity they're exposed to in storage. Is your grinder normally close to anything that produces steam? Is your kitchen air really humid? Are the beans stored in air-tight containers? If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem.</p>

<p>It can also be the bean, some roasts just <em>do not</em> do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage. </p>

<p>Both <a href=""http://www.lavazza.us/us/products/blends/espresso/qualita-oro/"">Lavazza</a> and <a href=""http://shop.illy.com/online/store/product_coffee-all-us_whole-bean-medium-roast_us"">Illy</a> produce a <em>very</em> pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder. They are <em>very</em> consistent in production, delicious, and should give you a good baseline to select other beans that would work similarly well. You <em>can</em> get beans that weren't specifically produced with espresso in mind to work, but it takes a bit of tinkering. I recommend the above beans very often to people just getting started because they're delicious and very easy to work with.</p>

<p>Anyway, try one of those, see what comes out of the grinder. If you're still getting clumps that don't immediately break down when you tamp (tap the portafilter on the sides a few times before you tamp to help this) you could try cleaning the grinder, changing how you store the beans, or looking at a de-humidifier in the area that you keep them. </p>

<p>You can get 12-cup french press pots very easily, and probably larger ones.

<p>On the other hand, roast level is a controllable process that greatly affects bean size.  Beans expand and become less dense as they are roasted and lose moisture.

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract:
  The common-sense use of the term addiction is that regular consumption is irresistible and that it creates problems. Caffeine use does not fit this profile. Its intake does no harm to the individual or to society and its users are not compelled to consume it. Though cessation of regular use may result in symptoms such as headache and lethargy, these are easily and reliably reversed by ingestion of caffeine. Some have argued that continued caffeine use is an attempt to suppress low grade withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness and lethargy. In some moderate users, this is possible; however, in experimental contexts, the phenomenon is too inconsistent to constitute a reliably valid syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current article on point in <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/balance/caffeine-myths-and-facts#1"" rel=""nofollow"">WebMD</a> says that caffeine addiction is a myth, with ""some truth to it,"" concluding: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This one has some truth to it, depending on what you mean by ""addictive."" Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system, and regular use of caffeine does cause mild physical dependence. But caffeine doesn't threaten your physical, social, or economic health the way addictive drugs do.   </p>

Unit, <a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/psychiatry/research/bpru/docs/caffeine_dependence_fact_sheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> based on several studies, the sheet describes responses to a phone survey in which between 9% and 30% (depending on the symptoms offered) of caffeine users admitted symptoms associated (by psychiatrists) with addiction.

<p>So, it surprisingly makes pretty good espresso! It takes really pleasant, but its missing on major element of a good espresso shot: the crema!!

I then ""tamp"" the coffee down with a flat spoon. I put it into my machine, turn it on, and wait like a minute for the hot espresso to come out. It sort of gives something similar to crema, but it seems for just like foam, and it doesn't last very long either. </p>

<p>Is there a way to generate crema using a steam espresso machine, or is it really not possible? Am I doing something wrong? Any feedback is appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>With a steam-powered espresso machine (especially if it's an entry level machine), you will typically not reach high enough pressure to get a proper crema.

Your steam-powered machine will probably not produce more than ~3 bars of pressure.</p>

<p>Tamping with a spoon also seems not ideal, because it will be very difficult to achieve an even tamp. I cannot comment on how important that is for this particular machine, but with higher end pump machines it might lead to channeling and uneven extraction.</p>

This is not traditional tamping, but somewhat similar.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that the reason for the  improvement in flavor seems to be the longer extraction time: If the basket is only half full, I mostly tend to get underextracted, somewhat sour-ish coffee. Compacting the grounds a bit results in more resistance to the hot water and, thus, a longer contact time. (Not sure if that hypothesis is correct, but the result is easy to reproduce for me.)</p>

<p>Another theory is that the pipes within the machine are not clean. </p>

<p>You can test both. </p>

So, the easiest (minimal amount of work in the morning) would be a drip coffee.  Definitely an upgrade from instant.  Many of machines allow you to preset the wake up time, so that you prepare everything at night, and then you wake in the morning to a ready cup (or two) of coffee waiting for you.</p>

<p>As to a way to make coffee - that is a purely opinion based question. Some people love espresso. I like my french press.  Some love their morning cappuccino, etc.  You have to experiment and find your drink of choice. 
But the first best thing you can do, is to buy a whole bean coffee and grind it yourself.  The taste difference (specially after an instant coffee) will be enormous!</p>

You are talking about purposefully inducing a cycle of addiction/dependence and withdrawal, however, I am not sure I have ever heard that the exercise tolerance from caffeine decreases as caffeine tolerance increases.</p>

<p>In cycling (a sport I am familiar with) most pros maintain some level of caffeine tolerance.  I've the routine before the day's workout is an espresso or two.  I've never heard of cycling that caffeine intake.  With a doping and performance maximization such a ever present in cycling, it seems like if there was really benefit to cycling, it would be happening.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.livescience.com/5374-coffee-lessens-pain-exercise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">This article</a> suggests that the exercise tolerance is the same or similar regardless of the level of caffeine dependence. (<a href=""http://users.clas.ufl.edu/msscha/premed/caffeine_musclepain.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">actual study here</a>) The most I could find online for cycling was some bodybuilding forums talking about cycling their pre-workout stimulants.  Not really any specific information about what is contained in the mess of supplements they are taking. </p>

<p>Based on that study and the lack of information for cycling caffeine tolerance, I'd suggest that the withdrawal symptoms and side effects of caffeine consumption on naive individuals are not worth the purported but undocumented benefit of cycling your caffeine consumption.  I think while it's true that some of the mental stimulation and other effects of caffeine may taper off with tolerance, the exercise tolerance benefit does not.  However, individuals ignorant of this, or seeking mainly the mental stimulant part of caffeine effects, may resort to cycling their caffeine intake.  </p>

<p>TL;DR The bottom line is for physical performance, there is not a reason to cycle.  For mental performance there is a build up of tolerance and off periods would provide a benefit at the cost of symptoms encountered during the withdrawal period.</p>

Although what I think you are really experiencing is a difference in mouth feel. Using a paper filter with certainly give the coffee clarity. Really fine paper filters (like a chemex filter - being thick and made from soft woods) will evidently filter out very small particles - which results in a very delicate, crisp, and light mouth feel tasting cup of coffee. On the opposite end of the spectrum you have the french press. Which you end up having tiny fine particles left in your end cup, which gives a great amount of body, and a very heavy mouth feel. Both are totally fine cups of coffee, but are totally subjective to your palate. </p>

<p>The thing about extraction is that you really only want to extract about 20% of the coffee you have. If you look at an extraction versus time graphed out, you can see that it represents the curve y=sqrt(x), where extraction continues to increase as time goes on, but at a slower and slower rate. All this means is that by simply letting your coffee brew longer, you are not exactly going to make it any stronger past a certain point. You simply just need to add more coffee. As for the filter - your over all brew strength, or total dissolved solids - should basically be the exact same compared to if you didn't filter it with paper. The main difference is how it's being presented to your mouth. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSquf.png"" alt=""Extraction versus Time graph""></a></p>

2279,2,,2015-11-14T05:12:14.917,4,,"<p>I would recommend looking for which coarse setting seems to produce the most even grind. Really, the only potential danger you have is grinding so fine that you can't push the screen down.</p>

<p>The reason I recommend this is, like you mentioned, because everything else can be altered to your coffee's grind - the water temperature and extraction time. So you'll want to dial in a grind that's going to be evenly extracted. If your most coarse setting gives you big chunks and a lot of fine particles as well, then you're either going to over extract the fine and under extract the coarse, or vice versa depending on your brew time.</p>

<p>I hesitate to give you a dogmatic answer because I don't want to mislead you, but I also understand that it takes time to recognize even grinding and the grind size that is appropriate for the brew method. So I'll say that somewhere around medium to medium-coarse is going to be better. With smaller burr grinders, the coarsest setting has pretty uneven results.</p>

<p>Also, try playing with the extraction time. Start with two minutes, then try 3, on up to 5. If you keep everything consistent, you should be able to find exactly what works/tastes best for your situation.</p>

2280,2,,2015-11-14T05:25:17.560,4,,"<p>Just guessing here, but the hole could keep the water from going up until it reaches a certain temperature. The amount of pressure from the steam varies on the temperature of the water, and if there weren't enough pressure, the water would recycle. However, if the pressure were greater, the velocity of the water would prevent it from dripping out of the hole.</p>

<p>This could explain the bursts, since the pressure would rise and fall depending on the amount of water it pushed out. The more water that escapes, the more room there is left behind for pressure to fill.</p>

<p>Also, you mentioned a weird taste. Could it be metallic? If so, you could try letting the base sit in a strong coffee/water mixture for a couple days. The moka pot needs to be seasoned to prevent this taste, so I would recommend not washing it with soap - just rinse. My grandmother has never washed hers.</p>

<p>Coffee can stain teeth. Is that a health issue? It's often listed with other dental health issues but I'm not sure why. </p>

<p>The acidity of coffee may wear down teeth over time, but it's not a prime suspect. The acidity of coffee generally falls somewhere between that of pure water and cow's milk, according to one <a href=""http://www.highergroundstrading.com/blog/38/coffee-acidity:-the-science-and-the-experience--"">article.</a> Fruit juice and soft drinks are far more acidic (pH &lt; 3). Coffee is only slightly more acidic than saliva. There is no shortage of articles claiming high acidity of coffee but 
a pH of 5--a plausible average--is not very high.</p>

<p>There are probably hundreds of studies in English alone on the effect of coffee on dental health. In terms of acidity it's not as bad as juice and not as benign as water. The plaque-preventive effect is something new to consider. There is also a 2012 study by the American Cancer Society suggesting that coffee lowers the risk of oral cancer. Those who drank 4+ cups of coffee a day were about half as likely to die of oral/pharyngeal cancer as those who drank occasionally or not at all. Coffee, Tea, and Fatal Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer in a Large Prospective U.S. Cohort, <em>American Journal of Epidemiology,</em> Dec. 2012 (online), Hildebrand et al. To the extent that oral cancer is a dental health issue this is also something to weigh.  </p>

<p>Science doesn't necessarily furnish a simple answer. It appears that the mildly corrosive effect of coffee may be offset by a tendency to reduce plaque. If coffee helps reduce the risk of oral cancer one could argue that, overall, the benefits of coffee for dental health outweigh the risks. </p>

Coca-Cola, tea and chocolate also have caffeine. So, the question is not about regulating coffee, but products that roughly 75% of human race consumes.</p>

<p>Second, you have a little sip of cynicism and realize that regulations rarely ate about health. Marijuana was banned mostly to have a legal way to persecute coloured people in USA and to create a market reserve for synthetic fibres against hemp fibres. The UK even fought a war against China for opium. All the regulations we have today on tobacco and alcohol needed to be earned in rough disputes against rich and powerful industrial lobbies. So, even if coffee does some harm to health any restriction is very implausible. </p>

<p>But we don't have any strong evidence that coffee cause any harm to health. Caffeine is addictive, fact, but the addiction <em>per si</em> is not a problem. There are no social drawbacks, like alcoholism and strong drug addiction (lost of work productivity, domestic violence)  and no big social health cost, like tobacco and alcohol.</p>

<p>So any regulation should be based only in the moral aspect that a addiction, even a without social consequences, should be avoided and our social resources should be used by the state to prevent this.</p>

<p>But anything can be addictive. MMORPGS, Netflix, coffee... Should we regulate all things based in this moral argument?</p>

<p>TL:DR</p>

<p>NO.</p>

<p>There is no social consequence of addiction of caffeine to justify the use of social resources by the government regulating it.</p>

Essentially, you use the caffeine as a propellant to your natural &quot;up&quot; rhythm. <a href=""http://food-hacks.wonderhowto.com/how-to/youre-drinking-coffee-wrong-heres-really-maximize-your-daily-caffeine-boosts-0150662/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gabrielle Taylor's article</a> does a fine job of explaining this:</p>

<p>When you drink coffee during the time when your body is already releasing cortisol, it won't have as strong an effect. Ideally, you want to get your caffeine during the lulls between cortisol spikes—otherwise, you start to develop a tolerance and have to drink more to get the same effect.</p>
<p>Assuming you're on a regular sleep schedule, your cortisol levels naturally spike about an hour after you wake up. If you get up at 7 am, your body is naturally most awake between 8 and 9 in the morning, noon to 1 pm, and again around 5:30-6:30 pm.</p>
<p>So, based on a wake time of 7 am, the best times to drink your caffeine vehicle of choice are 9:30-11:30 am and 1:30-5:00 pm. Obviously you can adjust the schedule according to your own wake time if it's earlier or later.</p>

Immediately after the addition of the strawberry preparation to yoghurt, β-lactoglobulin decreased to values lower than the limit of detection and α-lactalbumin by approximately 34%, and was reduced further slowly throughout yoghurt self-life.

<blockquote>
  <p>Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are antioxidants found in coffee. They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), or the time needed to reach Cmax (Tmax). The Cmax of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the Tmax of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the Tmax and Cmax but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're starting a small business, in which case, you will quickly outgrow 5 gallon batch sizes as you begin distribution. </p>

<p>Depending on your needs, I would suggest purchasing industrial beer brewing equipment, such as conical fermenters and brite tanks. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Use of Conical Fermenter</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtmjA.jpg"" alt=""Conical Fermenter""></a></p>

<p>The conical fermenter would allow you to long brew a batch, bubble nitrogen or CO2 up from the bottom for agitation (increasing extraction and preventing oxidation), and will let the grinds settle into the bottom shoulder of the tank when the brewing process is complete. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Use of Brite Tanks</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iggKD.jpg"" alt=""Large Brite Tank""></a> </p>

<p>Brite tanks come in a range of sizes from ~1 gallon up to tens of thousands of gallons. They are primarily used as a glycol jacketed pressure rated storage vessel for keeping beer (and similar beverages) in optimial conditions before storage. They may also be used as part of the forced carbonation of the liquid in the tank.  A brite tank will be useful for your cold brew business as you scale up because it will give you an intermediary vessel to blend out and store batches before packaging. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Scaling up your production</h2>

<p>Depending on your business plans and packaging / distribution ability, 
you will probably want to start with a slightly larger setup that gives you 1) room to grow and 2) the ability to expand without changing process or systems. Beer equiptment is well suited to meet these goals. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Quality, consistency, and some notes on process:</h2>

<p>The majority of consumers demand a consistent product with an interesting flavor-profile that they can enjoy <em>every</em> time they purchase your product. Flavor-profile deviations will cause you to loose consumers to a more consistent product in the long run. The following points will help ensure a more consistent product: </p>

<ol>
<li>blend out batches of cold brew from the fermenters into a single brite tank</li>
<li>use CO2 or nitrogen to prevent oxidation</li>
<li>manual agitation is inconsistent - use a bubbler with CO2 or nitrogrn instead. This will also help with goal 2. </li>
<li>Packaging lines make a huge difference. Invest for growth in a rotary topper, not a 4 or 6 head. </li>
<li>Don't attempt to use the same blend of beans for cold brew, draft cold brew, and nitro. </li>

<p>A technical term in the literature is &quot;oral clearance&quot;, meaning the rate at which a drug administered orally is removed from the body, the three elimination pathways being renal, hepatic, and pneumatic.  As the references in the above link document, caffeine is eliminated primarily by the liver breaking it down into paraxanthine (84%), theobromine (12%), and theophylline (4%).  While these last two compounds have some CNS effects, it is believed that largely caffeine itself acts by competing with adenosine for adenosine receptors.</p>

<hr />
<p>The simplest way to extend a caffeine buzz (setting aside pregnancy as impractical for most) is to consume more caffeine.  [A more difficult challenge might be finding a way to <em>shorten</em> the duration of a coffee buzz.]</p>
<p>A 1985 study <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00544361"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">by Abernethy and Todd</a>, &quot;Impairment of caffeine clearance by chronic use of low-dose oestrogen-containing oral contraceptives&quot;, demonstrated that the half-life of caffeine is extended by progesterone administration.</p>
<p>You say that you wish to consume as little coffee as possible, so perhaps the same amount of coffee (espresso, once every other day) could be taken in divided doses.  This then converts the problem into how to create an equally intense buzz with (say) only half the caffeine.</p>
<p>I've noticed is that a sharp reduction in carbohydrates leads (after a couple of weeks, with mild ketosis) to a stronger physiological response to caffeine.</p>
<p>I can only offer this as an anecdotal observation.  There is research on the interaction of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20521321"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">caffeine and glucose on cognitive processing</a> and on the effects of <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/5/1254.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">caffeine consumption on glucose homeostasis</a>.

<p>Commodity coffee <em>may</em> be especially susceptible to this sort of chicanery because, although it is highly regulated, it may be stored in large quantities and even a slight delay in delivery (perhaps to influence the market) can result in spoilage. <em>Penicillium</em> mold is present in most unroasted beans as an <a href=""http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/person/5818/Penicilliumspeciesendophyticincoffeeplants--Mycologia9831-42.pdf"">endophyte</a>--normally benign but capable of causing damage under the right conditions, and other <a href=""http://www.teaandcoffee.net/0507/coffee.htm"">mold pathogens</a> can ruin coffee if a narrow range of storage climate is exceeded.  </p>

2316,2,,2015-11-29T04:31:31.310,13,,"<p>Here's a few thoughts based on what causes sourness/acidity in coffee and ways to temper it.</p>

<p><strong>Order an <em>espresso lungo</em>.</strong> Sourness (acidity) is characteristic of the ""stuff"" that is extracted relatively early in the brewing process. In other brewing methods that take longer to perform (e.g., coffee press, drip, or pour-over) this can be balanced by the more bitter notes that take somewhat longer to fully extract. For this reason, you might get a result that is more appealing to you by ordering an espresso that takes longer to pull, i.e., espresso <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungo"">lungo</a>. Not everyone behind every coffee counter will be immediately familiar with this, but at good cafes with good machines an espresso lungo should be no problem.</p>

<p><strong>Try a <em>darker roast</em>.</strong> Darker roast coffees tend to be less acidic than lighter roasts, at the expense of losing more of the varietal/regional notes. Many cafes have really only one bean/roast that they use for every espresso (often because of the practical considerations of having several grinder hoppers full of beans), but if you have an option, try a darker-roasted bean.</p>

<p><strong>Try beans from a <em>different region</em>.</strong> To my taste, Indonesian coffees tend to have less pronounced acidic notes than African or American coffees. Again, if multiple coffees are available for espresso, pick a coffee that you like (or find less sour) for any other preparation.</p>

<p><strong>Pick beans further off of the roast.</strong> This is really only for completeness, but beans that were <em>very</em> freshly/recently roasted (i.e., less than a few days) can have accentuated acidity because some undesirable volatiles haven't yet had a chance to leach out. This is more toward what @daniel noted; this is the kind of thing <em>you</em> shouldn't need to be concerned about at a cafe -- <em>they</em> should!</p>

<p>A cafe affiliated with a local roaster (or any specialty cafe) should be able to tell you lots of things about the coffee when asked, such as region, varietal, roast level, and roast date. Here's a <a href=""http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2013/07/home-coffee-brewing-troubleshooting-grind-size-brew-time.html"">Serious Eats article about ""problems""</a> and related solutions that touch on some of the things I talked about above.

<p>I am from Germany. We typically use [ml] for volumetric meassurements. Whenever I come across a recipe quoting ""cups"" I start my research: Where did it originate? Is it from the US?

<p>Similar rues apply for coffee, from a small espresso or mokka cup in southern Europe or the Arab world to a mug of filtered coffee in the US. </p>

<p>There seems to be one correlation though - the ""stronger"" (=more concetrated) a coffe is customarily prepared, the smaller the cup.

Lee Denny explains this <a href=""http://EzineArticles.com/6568161"" rel=""noreferrer"">in his article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing is for sure: a &quot;cup&quot; of coffee does not fill up the typical 12 oz. coffee mug found in most American homes.</p>
<p>Ounces per Cup in Popular Coffee Maker Brands</p>
<p>Bunn: 5 oz</p>
<p>Bodum (Vacuum): 5.7 oz</p>
<p>Capresso: 5 oz</p>
<p>Cona: 5.5 oz to 5.7 oz</p>
<p>Cuisinart: 5 oz</p>
<p>Krups: 5 oz</p>
<p>Proctor Silex: 4.5 oz</p>
<p>Technivorm: 4.2 oz</p>
<p>Zojirushi: 5.1 oz</p>
<p>To complicate things even further, coffee brewing instructions frequently tell you how much ground coffee to add for every 6 ounces of water. You'll see this metric on the back of a can of Maxwell House as well as published by coffee authorities such as the National Coffee Association of U.S.A., Inc. Further proof of the lack of standardization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, neither is their an internationally recognized standard measure for what a &quot;cup&quot; is since American uses cup measurements while many other countries use kitchen scales to mete out ingredients by weight. <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/equipment/dear-americans-im-fed-up-with-your-stupid-cup-measurements/"" rel=""noreferrer"">This entertaining article</a> Sue Quinn wrote for The Telegraph explores this difference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here in the UK, we love your food, we really do. We guzzle your dirty burgers, crave your Cronuts and scoff your hot dogs like there’s no tomorrow. But your recipes are giving us heartburn. Why on earth do your cookbooks and food websites cling to cup measures when kitchen scales are much easier, more precise and infinitely less faff?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A general guideline is one to two tablespoons of ground coffee for every six ounces of water. This can be adjusted to suit individual taste preferences.</p>
<p>Be sure to check the “cup” lines on your brewer to see how they actually measure. And remember that some water is lost to evaporation in certain brewing methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are still interested in pursuing cup measurement, it may interest you to know that Fannie Farmer is given much credit for establishing the American way of measuring ingredients as noted by Bill Daily in <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-21/features/sc-food-0316-giants-farmer-20120321_1_fannie-merritt-farmer-cookbook-marion-cunningham"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Chicago Tribune article</a>:</p>

<p>The success was moderate, partly because it was a pan roast, and I'm still new at this, however it makes for a fun experiment, and introduces you to the roasting process (as if I needed to fixate on coffee more..).</p>

<p>A nice roasting guide is <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/pro2/panroastingcoffee/howtopanroastcoffee2.html/"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. When the part where the bean oils start to develop comes, that's where you throw in no more than 4 or 5 teaspoons of the oil with the flavor you want. Of course, you can adjust this with smell, and depending on the amount of beans you're roasting. You then go on with the process according to instructions. </p>

<p>For peanut butter flavour, since I found no PB oil with a quick search, I'd add the oil on top of a jar, or mix concentrated oils that make something near the yummy PB flavor</p>

I've read that re-roasting beans isn't practical for some reason that I'm not clear on, but I agree with Peter Pei Guo's, comment about why you would want to re-roast coffee in the first place.  </p>

<p>Immediately after roasting, coffee beans produce carbon dioxide gas as a result of the chemical changes happening inside the bean.  This gas takes some time to be released from the interior of the bean, anywhere <strong>from 3-5 days</strong>.  </p>

<p>I've brewed my own home roasted coffee immediately after roasting to see if this is really true, and yes, it is.  </p>

<p>Immediately after roasting the coffee has a really harsh, sour taste from the acidity that accompanies carbon dioxide gas (carbolic acid).  It also foamed (bloomed) really violently with the addition of hot water.  After resting the roasted coffee for about <strong>5 days</strong>, the coffee from the same batch of beans <strong>tasted great</strong>. </p>

<p>One of <strong>the indicators</strong> of freshly roasted coffee beans is <strong>the bloom</strong> that they produce as some residual carbon dioxide gas is released with <strong>the addition of hot water</strong>.  </p>

<p>As <em>time passes</em> and the beans begin to stale a bit, the <em>bloom lessens</em>, then <strong>disappears</strong>.  After properly resting freshly roasted coffee however, <strong>the small amount of residual carbon dioxide doesn't affect the taste</strong>.  Immediately <em>after roasting</em> however, the <em>carbon dioxide</em> levels are <strong>too high</strong> to allow good tasting coffee when brewed.  </p>

Like, ‘more than one a day,’ into. I've got an old Nespresso machine from when I first started drinking coffee and espresso, and didn't know which I'd like more (I took both straight at the time.)</p>

<p>I've started trying to make my own lattes at home with the Nespresso, to save money and time, but I have no idea what I'm doing, and I'm having terrible results. Most importantly, I can't figure out how a Starbucks barista is getting <em>twenty ounces</em> of final product, from two shots of espresso. When I'm using the Nespresso (pull one ‘latte’, pull a second ‘lungo’ into the latte), I get maybe 9oz of coffee-product; and that's <em>stretching</em> the phrase, as it's basically slightly-coffee-tainted steamed-milk. (It's barely even brown!)</p>

A Starbucks “Venti” is named for the twenty oz volume and contains three shots. </p>

<p>But that's basically a puddle in your mug:<br>
You need to fill the other 16 oz. and you do that with <strong>steamed (foamy) milk</strong>. If you wanted to do this ""correctly"", you would use the steam wand of your espresso machine - which the Nespresso doesn't have, I presume.   </p>

<ul>
<li>If you have an immersion blender, preferably with a disk, heat (not boil!) your milk and whizz it until you get soft foam.   </li>
<li>Other options are a stovetop or electric milk frother - the manual pump-action ones are available for the price of four to five Starbucks coffees, the electric ones cost a bit more. </li>
<li>Do not buy one of these teeny-tiny hand-held flimsy wire-whisk stirrers, they are a funny gadget but not sturdy enough for daily use and large volumes of milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>The milk-to-foam-to-espresso ratio is up to you, find what you like best. I suggest starting somewhere at about two thirds milk / one third foam plus three shots and tweak your drink until you find your preferred recipe.</p>

<p>Note that the Italian term caffè denotes the strong black liquid you get from an esspesso machine or a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"">moka</a>. </p>

<p>The coffee in a tiramisu has to be concentrated to supply enough flavour without soaking the ladyfingers or other bisquits used. (The same principle applies when you use a liquor.)</p>

<p>When choosing the beans /the roast, the same rule as for wine applies: Use what you drink. And seriously, unless you are making an insane amount of tiramisu, you will be using only very little of one pack of coffee.<br>
I use whatever I choose for my Espresso (if I feel rich, I'll splurge on something from my local roaster, in a pinch the usual suspects like Illy or Lavazza, sometimes even a Starbucks Espresso roast <em>cough</em>) and call it a day.</p>

<p>So in sort, get a classic Italian espresso roast, prepare it authentically and you should be fine. In a pinch, use another coffee, but make sure it is very strong. You'll need a few tablespoons tops for a standard tiramisu recipe.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.barkingdogcoffee.com/our-coffee/arabica-vs-robusta/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barkingdogcoffee.com/our-coffee/arabica-vs-robusta/</a></p>

<p>A cup of joe at Peets, Starbucks, etc, will be made with Arabica beans exclusively, and therefore have a lot less caffeine than the Robusta instant coffee.</p>

<p>It also depends on how finely you grind your french press grounds. You may be getting more solids in your cup of coffee with a french press (and it's hard to compare french press vs instant coffee by weight since instant is so processed). Also, some Arabica beans have more caffeine content than others. Thus, you may well be getting more caffeine from the dosage of french press coffee than your instant coffee.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>""Moka"" grind is imperative.</strong> Most guidelines that I have seen recommend somewhere coarser than espresso and finer than drip (e.g., <a href=""http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/en/coffee-at-home/coffee-for-moka"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">illy</a>, <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/bialetti-moka-pot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blue Bottle</a>, and a bunch of blogs when searching ""best grind for moka"" or so). Finer and you might overextract and result in a bitter brew; too-coarse and the machine won't extract properly or develop any pressure in the bottom chamber.</li>
<li><strong>The amount of water is almost completely determined by the size of the moka pot</strong>. Fill nearly (but not quite) up to the over-pressure relief valve; looks a bit like a button. The moka pot is made to brew exactly that amount of coffee; no more, no less.</li>
<li>(exactly as you said). Amount of coffee: filled to the top of the funnel, but not tamped.</li>
<li>Heat: for a gas-flame-burner, as with any pot, matched to pot size is best. <strong>The flame being completely under and within the base is best.</strong> It should heat quickly, but the flame should not creep around the sides; you want the bottom to be heated only, not the sides and certainly not the top vessel! This is the reason for the shape of this and a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cezve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cezve</a> having a wide bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Turn off as soon as the machine starts coughing or sputtering.</strong> At this point the water level is below the bottom of the funnel straw, and no more (desirable) extraction will occur.</li>
<li><strong>Serve as soon as safe!</strong> Soon after the fire is off, it should stop sputtering. Best to pour and serve immediately thereafter. </li>
</ol>

<p>and...</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>One thing you didn't mention: <strong>it's best to fill the bottom chamber (carefully!) with already-boiling water</strong> (as in Blue Bottle guide, linked above.) This ensures that the water boils quickly and evenly, and minimizes the amount of (undesirable) ""steaming"" and heat prior to brewing to which the grounds will be subjected.</li>
</ol>

<p>As for the crema, I've never been able to create crema with anything other than a proper espresso machine, as noted in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/97/generating-crema-with-a-moka-pot"">this moka question I had linked</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li>beans roasting and time passed.</li>
<li>beans grounding and time passed.</li>

<li>water desalination frequency.</li>
<li>general cleanliness of the machine and the environment.</li>
<li><strong>lower water temperature of extraction. If the machine temperature is lower due lack of periodical calibration, the coffee tastes sour and flat.</strong> </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Preparation related:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>extracted coffee exposure to the atmosphere. The longer is stays exposed, the more it reacts with the atmospheric oxygen and oxidizes, thus becoming more sour. This is true especially for all the coffees with added water (<em>Americano, lungo</em>) that breaks the thin layer covering and preserving the coffee's nice taste qualities.</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Consumption of additional beverage or/and snack together with the coffee. </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>if the additional food or/and drink consumed together with the coffee contains more sugar, then your coffee will always taste sour.</strong> (The effect is similar to when you eat chocolate first and then eat an apple, the apple tastes much sour.) </p></li>
<li><p>smoking affects taste receptors as well and it should be taken into consideration, i.e. you receptors are less sensitive and there is no point in buying coffee from high-end shops, as you are unable to feel the taste.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Generally, if you want to experience the best quality of a given espresso, you should order it <em>ristretto</em>. The ordinary espresso extraction time is around 25 seconds (1ml / sec) and you get a full shot. <em>Ristretto</em> reduces the extraction time, usually by half, and cuts the last drops of water that contain lower concentration of coffee extract, thus keeping the strong <em>aroma</em> and different <em>taste balance</em>. In the ideal case it should be consumed as fast as possible, just like a gourmé meal.</p>

<p>As an argument I will point out that oxidization is an effect that can not be prevented easily and once exposed to the atmosphere the coffee interacts with the environment via the moisture it absorbs and all the smells contained within it. That is why <em>Illy</em> seals its containers with Nitrogen to try and isolate it from the environment, as much as possible, till it is opened. </p>

2370,2,,2015-12-22T17:46:09.747,16,,"<p>You have already listed most of the main points and hit them correctly, but I'll add some additional.</p>

<p>Pros:
You can get things not available commercially, and generally a much wider variety of coffee.  For instance, almost all Sumatran coffee is traditionally dark roasted by companies.  However, light roasted Sumatran coffee has a truly unique set of flavors that is fairly distinct from anything else, without light roasting some yourself, you'd be hard pressed (or French pressed if you are into that) to ever find it fresh.  Tastes are remarkably individual and it's highly likely that you like may really like some random type of coffee that either isn't a big seller and available, or isn't traditionally roasted how you prefer. </p>

<p>Cons:
Time.  Roasting takes some amount of your time.  It takes far more when you start (I can now roast a pound of coffee in roughly 5 minutes of my time, because the machine does most of the work and I have a system).  Depending on your equipment and learning curve, this can vary widely.  With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.  </p>

<p>Snobbery.  You will likely get to the point were most other coffee that's commercially produced will be unthinkable to you.  I can't drink coffee at any restaurant without cream (I normally drink it black).  I have a few friends who roast and their coffee is the exception.  But, more or less, home roasting may ruin ""other"" coffee for you.  Along these lines, you may get to the point where you don't enjoy roasting as much anymore, you just want the coffee.  If your time curve is fine, then it works out.  If it's not you might be left with the terrible choice between doing something you don't love or buying less good coffee.</p>

<p><em>Roast A</em> will always float when pouring hot water over, throughout the entire brewing process.</p>

My first thought was maybe it had to do with freshness of the roasted bean, but A and B could have the same roast date (less than a week old) and still act as described.

<li>The thermal capacity... The thermal capacity must be high. It's hard to explain this on text. The cezve must be a bit sturdy. This is all I can say. The copper ones aren't generally sturdy. A bit thicker stainless steel ones are nicer for that. So, you can brew your coffee fast and also homogeneously distribute the heat. This is quite important when preparing your coffee in your own hands. The traditional copper ones are traditional as copper was easier to produce historically. Steel is easier to shape now. So, you can go for steel. An indicator for good thermal capacity is the boiling character of your coffee. If your coffee starts to boil from the edges, then it is possible that the thermal capacity is less than it should be (or the fire is way too strong to brew coffee).</li>
<li>The bottom must be a bit larger than the top. So you can easily keep it on the oven.</li>
<li>The slope I can advice is abut 10 degrees from bottom to top for best brewing.</li>
<li>The height must not be more than 10-15 centimeters to stir the coffee easily.</li>
<li>Take care about right/left-handedness. Some cezves have the option to flow the coffee only on one side.</li>

2382,2,,2015-12-30T21:05:09.077,4,,"<p>To start, I would highly doubt the beans were roasted there in store.  Roasting at a commercial level takes large specialized equipment that would be dangerous for average customers to be around (400F+ after all) and create a smell that would easily fill the entire store and be unpleasant to some customers.  </p>

<p>That being said, unless there is a roasting date on the bag, there isn't really a way to tell exactly when the beans were roasted.  </p>

<p>The oils on the outside of a bean can mean many things.  Any given bean will generally become more oily and shinier as it is roasted darker and the oils migrate to the outside of the bean.  This is a process that happens near instantaneously with the roasting process.  However, it also continues much more slowly after the roasting process and beans that have been improperly stored or become stale may become more oily than they were immediately after roasting.  However, some processing methods will also produce beans that become more oily earlier in the roast process.  Dry processed coffee will often start to oil at a much lower roast level that coffee processed by current wet methods.  </p>

<p>The oil does not make the process less efficient by any noticeable measure.  Some of the oil is transferred to the paper filter and some ends up in a cup.  Many people claim to prefer metal mesh filters because more of the oil (and flavor) ends up in the cup.  However, other people claim they can't tell the difference.  The oiliness CAN affect the grinding process if the grinding machine is gravity fed and the beans cling to each other or the container too much.  </p>

<p>TL;DR The oil level or sheen of the coffee can't tell you much unless you know other things about the coffee as well.  It doesn't effect the brew process very much either.</p>

<p>Besides <em>taste of the water itself</em>, the very <em>nature of the water</em> (e.g. minerals and other water factors like pH that was cited by OP) will have an effect on extraction also. That is, different ""water"" will actually <em>extract differently</em>. This is a marginally distinct from a simple sum-of tastes; i.e., taste-of-water plus taste-of-coffee is not necessarily the whole story.</p>

<p>As I suggested before, <strong>try the extreme of bottled water as your comparison: distilled water.</strong> Though not always recommended (for a variety of reasonable and/or dubious reasons; more below) it will be the most stark comparison you can make that is reasonably easy. Holding all other factors as constant as possible, brew with your tap water and with distilled water.

If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine. If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine.

<p>I believe to understand the two or three times boiling mystery of Turkish coffee, you must understand the whole Turkish-style extraction process. I tell you the whole story.</p>

<p>The chemistry is simple: we are extracting some oils from the beans. Two known ways out there, pressure or heat. Turkish extraction is the traditional, genuine, historical heating way. Actually, it is probably the first and easiest way manhood used in history to prepare coffee (I believe both in Africa and then in Ottoman Empire).</p>

<p>When you heat the beans to extract, you need lots of surface to extract efficiently. That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.)</p>

<p>Then, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them.</p>

<p>Bingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process.</p>

<p>You should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now.</p>

<p><strong>Talking about best practice, let me show you a best practice.</strong></p>

<p>Get you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)</p>

<p>Measure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.</p>

<p>After you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.</p>

<p>You will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/njG5o.jpg"" alt=""Fire setting for Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>After a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet. Cause, we didn't stir it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMNTQ.jpg"" alt=""Greasy sunk Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>Start stirring.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDABM.jpg"" alt=""Stir the Turkish coffee""></a> </p>

<p>Now, stop. Please check the foam. You have a quite nice foam already. Very very light color. No bubbles at all. It is not mature yet. If you want to be experienced in Turkish-style coffee brewing, look at that foam a lot. Follow its color and forms.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRWh.jpg"" alt=""Foam of Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>Stir again. For about a minute. Stirring keeps the foam intact. You may stop from time to time to check the color and then continue. It gets mature when you first see the red/fire color.</p>

<p>Check the second image. Could you see the firefox there? Could you? Ok, now it is time for the first shot. Actually, I would like you to compare the second foam image with the one above. Try to figure out the differences. We started with light color, it turned out to red/fire color. We started with no bubbles, it has bubbles now.</p>

<p>We'll pour some of the coffee to our fincans. I pour the foamy part and fill about 2/5 of my fincans.</p>

<p>Still, I have enough foam and lots of oils to extract in my ground beans. I continue to heat and stir. Don't forget to stir and keep foam intact. This time the foam turns from red/fire to brown/coffee-bean-color. Still, I'm very far from boiling. Fill another 2/5 of your fincans. The fincans are nearly full.</p>

<p>I would like to keep your attention to one point. At this point, you see the famous marbled foam of Turkish coffee for the first time. The reason is, you've mixed two different subsets of oils for the first time. Our final destination is to produce a coffee foam marbled with three colors.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rzz6J.jpg"" alt=""Marbled foam of Turkish coffee""></a></p>

<p>Now, we hardly have any foam left in our cezve. We are heating the coffee for the last shot. This will be very close to the boiling point. You can hardly see any foam now, but mostly bubbles. At one point, the boiling starts in the middle. Take the cezve out of the fire very quickly to prevent burning the coffee and pour the rest of the coffee to the fincans.</p>

<p>(You really need to be quick, so I couldn't find time to focus and burnt the coffee a bit. Still, you can sense the boiling center. Sorry, for this picture and also I cannot provide a triple marbled foam for now as it burnt.)</p>

<p>Normally, there shouldn't be any grounds remain in cezve. Everything must be dissolved homogeneously in water.</p>

<p>Traditionally, we prefer to serve Turkish coffee with half a sip of liquor of sharp tastes. Like mint, quince, sour cherry or bitter almond. This time, it was hazelnut liquor.</p>

<p>Different brewing methods are thought to highlight different aspects of coffee aroma (e.g., darker roasts for espresso, but lighter for cold brew; see the <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/q/1562/277"">discussion here</a>). So often when you buy beans at a roastery, there is a recommendation regarding which methods are good for these beans &amp; roast. Thus, a random bag of beans I'm looking at suggests they are good for batch-brew, aeropress, pourover and french press, but not for moka of espresso. But because Turkish isn't a big thing in many countries, it's never mentioned.</p>

<p>May uneducated impression is that Turkish preserves the acidity and keeps bitterness low. Do you guys know what its profile really is?
Alternatively, maybe there is a way to predict the suitability of particular 
beans for Turkish based on its character compared to other methods. E.g., ""beans good for aeropress will often be good for Turkish"", or ""Turkish is the opposite of espresso"", etc.</p>

<p>I mean, I know when I like the coffee I made, so there are some favourites to my taste. But I can't disentangle the factors that contribute to my liking: is it the roast? the altitude? the mouthfeel? Which means I don't know what is more relevant, and this don't have properties to guide me in choosing new beans.</p>
",277,2016-01-02T14:15:33.150,What coffee and roast are best for Turkish?,<flavor><beans><turkish-coffee>,1,0,1,CC BY-SA 3.0,-1,2017-04-13T12:51:53.733,,,,,
2395,2,,2016-01-02T14:15:33.150,3,,"<p>I believe the answer will be subjective. But, I can answer based on some tradition and history.</p>

<p>The coffee beans <em>were</em> originated from Yemen in Ottoman Empire. At least, Yemen was a hub. (This fact is even mentioned in folk songs. See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFrRS9aNJJQ"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://tr.wikisource.org/wiki/Kahve_yemen&#39;den_gelir-1"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.) Historically, Robusta beans were not around, yet. Americas were not explored. So, if you want to follow the tradition, stick with African originated Arabica beans. Still, one should note that if you go for the current Turkish commercial ground coffee brands (like Mehmet Efendi, etc.) on the market, most of them include mostly Robusta beans from South America to keep the costs low. This is ugly face of horeca, I assume.</p>

<p><em>(African originated Arabicas are also my personal preference. My favorite is Ethiopian Harar. As far as I experienced, it is even better than Kopi Luwak for Turkish coffee. Also, this may be a hint. Kopi Luwak is known for low acidity. So, low acidity beans were not good for my taste even it was Kopi Luwak. On the other hand, Kopi Luwak was great while brewed with pressure.)</em></p>

<p>For roasting the beans, you generally do not need to burn the beans to eliminate the acidity. So, light roasts are OK for Turkish coffee. Majority of commercial brands prepare City roast and the minority prepare American roast (I think). If you taste burnt flavor in a package, it is clearly over roasted; you must be suspicious about the quality of the beans.</p>

<p><em>(My personal preference is a bit darker than that. City roast to full city roast.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Last words:</strong> I think, as Turkish coffee is just a brewing method, it is up to the drinkers taste either to add sugar/gum/cinnamon/milk or not, either to use Robusta or Arabica, either to roast light or dark. I mean, if the drinkers find it more delicious, they can boil it up for hours (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%B1rra"" rel=""nofollow"">It exists!</a>) before drinking. This is about the taste, so no boundaries. :)</p>

However, it doesn't fall within the standards of a true Italian espresso, as pointed out in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/298/277"">this answer</a>. In particular, you won't have any crema.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.wacaco.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Hand pumps</strong></a> are inexpensive, compact and light, and have the decent pressure of 8 bars. Although they are marketed as an espresso device for camping, they can be use wherever you have hot water.</p>

<p>Next in price are probably <strong>the capsule espresso machines</strong> (such as Nespresso and its clones), which many supermarket chains have cheap versions of. Very easy to use, but unsustainable (see <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/q/2501/2661"">here</a> and in the end of <a href=""https://www.choice.com.au/food-and-drink/drinks/tea-and-coffee/articles/coffee-capsules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), and coffee enthusiasts won't consider them an option because of the taste (see the previous link).

<p>And then come two best types: <strong>bean-to-cup</strong> and traditional <strong>espresso machines</strong> with a manually operated portafilter. They both are discussed in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/333/277"">this answer</a>. Both vary in price and quality significantly; probably a decent traditional machine may have a lower starting price than bean-to-cup machine.

For a drip coffee maker, most people will want to use a medium grind that balances getting enough extraction and still allowing the water to flow through the coffee grounds.  For immersion (boiled) coffee, you generally want a course grind that will slow extraction somewhat (reduce the chance of over extraction) and make the grounds less likely to end up in the final product.  </p>

<p>The answer is simply and clearly ""no"".</p>

<p>For the water to be able to travel to the top of the drip coffeemaker machine, it requires to gain some latent heat by changing its state to gas phase first. That's It simply means, it needs to be vaporized first.</p>

<p>Then, just at the top of the coffee and filter, there is a condensation space. At that space the gas (vapor) returns back to liquid phase (water) and starts to drip. Therefore, you obtain a slow flow of heated (to the near evaporation point) dripping water.</p>

<p>I cannot think any other way of bypassing this flow. Even in cheaper drip filter coffee makers.</p>

<p>A good reason to not use hot water from the tap is minerals.  Hot water from the tap that was heated in a hot water tank will likely have more minerals due to the tank itself, and these minerals will contribute to scaling in the machine.  Also hot water will have more mineral taste (but you probably would not taste it in coffee).</p>

<p>In general, the recommendations are to avoid hard foods (e.g., crusty bread, ice cubes, popcorn) or sticky foods (e.g., gum, hard candy, caramels), and to be careful of sweets in general (which can promote tooth decay in general but can be more difficult to clean-out with braces.)</p>

<p>There are several listed questions around the topic of eating coffee beans.  Ingesting roasted coffee beans without grinding/brewing them in some manner is quite common.  Many companies sell them specifically to be consumed this way.  Probably the main associated health risk would be caffeine overdose.  However, it's roughly the same as simply drinking far too much coffee.  The main difference being that since coffee (brewed) takes up so much more volume, you are likely to become physically uncomfortable from it before you could get to dangerous levels.  With coffee beans you could likely get to dangerous levels much easier since it would be possible to eat many more beans before experiencing the same ""fullness"" effect. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you feel the need to add sugar to your coffee, it may simply be that the coffee that you are drinking is not very good. Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are a couple of <strong>coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour</strong>. For example, I have a some ""Starbucks 2015 Christmas Blend Espresso"" here, which is described by the producer by ""Cedar and herbal spiciness with an intense caramelly sweetness"". When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. <strong>But don't expect too much.</strong> Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee"" rel=""noreferrer"">Arabica Bourbon</a> coffee beans should have a ""fine sweetness"". Panama Volcan Baru Coffee is also listed as particularly sweet. Against, don't expect too much - ""particularly sweet"" means in comparison to other beans!</p></li>
<li><p>In case you prefer to drink your coffee with milk, you may want to switch to lactose-free milk. In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. </p></li>

<hr>

<p>I have had the aeropress for a couple of years, but only recently I started trying different methods of making coffee.</p>

<p>I have run several experiments (I didn't document them. hat's off to andy!), and I have read a lot about what really IS an espresso, and how it's made.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>First of all, what most people are creating with the aeropress is NOT crema, but foam.
There is only 1 way to create crema, and it needs some extra equipment.
Pressing down REALLY hard !
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIfZ84qtBOc"" rel=""nofollow"">These guys have nailed it.</a></p>

<p>Also <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spressa/spressa-enhance-your-aeropress-experience"" rel=""nofollow"">Spressa Mezzo</a> is probably doing a good job. I can't find it locally though :(</p>

<p>Some science (sorry I lost all the links...): Espresso is defined by making hot water run through tamped ground coffee at around 9 bar pressure. Only then the oils are extracted. The process of extraction generates the crema.</p>

<p>So for aeropress, in order to generate 9 bars, the math tells that you have to press it with 294kg (plus some extra bit that I don't know how to calculate...). Let's call it 300. So you need a lever to do that. And you have to make the lever's math work out because you need as close to 9 bar as possible. More or less will not make an espresso.</p>

<p>That said, what I personally do is this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMuDiq-Tvaw"" rel=""nofollow"">How to Make REAL Espresso With a $20 Aeropress! - Tutorial (YouTube).</a></p>

<p>It is NOT ""real"" espresso, but I think it's the closest thing you can. And definitely the best method for aeropress.</p>

<p>One last thing: if you don't use a lever, which could actually generate crema (real espresso); don't worry about whether foam is created. It doesn't make a difference.</p>

<p>No... this is the last thing: With said, preferred method, timing doesn't matter. Personally that makes me enjoy more the process.</p>

<p>I have been trying to figure out what this special means.  Some roast their coffee with peanuts or cacao bean for flavor, some claim that because they grow coffee on a very high mountain or an especially cold climate that their coffee is now 'special'.</p>

2440,2,,2016-01-20T00:49:41.770,5,,"<p>There are not any firm guidelines established for what constitutes a specialty coffee.  Theoretically no one would consider anything made by Folgers to be a specialty coffee, and anything produced by a small local roaster should probably be considered specialty, but there is a lot of gray area in between.  For instance, some people may consider the bagged beans Starbucks sells to be specialty coffee, others (myself included) would not. Specialty is largely a marketing term like ""Cloud"" is for computing.  ""Cloud"" is used ambiguously for private, public, small, large, closed and open platforms.  </p>

<p>Generally I would define specialty coffee as something not produced and sold on a national scale.  Most specialty coffees are not ""branded"" by a company because they are bought in lots and sold sort of ""as is"".  That is, the roaster bought X amount and when they sell through it, it is gone.  This is opposed to a larger company that will always have ""Sumatra Special"" available for sale.</p>

<p>When you start talking about roasting with other things, or adding flavors, you have moved to ""flavored"" coffee, which I personally would never consider specialty coffee.  Oils and additional flavorings may be well liked by many people, but they can also be used to mask the shortcomings of less expensive beans and are generally used to produce a consistent tasting product.  </p>

<p>Lastly when you start talking about growing conditions, it can vary, and doesn't necessarily mean anything.  You can have beans that come from the same lot differ widely even in processing.  There is no ""perfect area"" to grow coffee and good coffee can be grown in a fairly well defined, but still variable conditions.  Advertising that coffee was grown in a specific place doesn't mean it was properly grown, harvested, processed or roasted well.  </p>

<p>When having a portafilter (professional espresso machine, as used for cappuccino etc) it sometimes happens that you prepare (e.g. attach the handle with coffee to the machine) and then something comes up and you don't start the extraction process right away. What happens then is that the hot machine heats up the ground coffee. Which in turn results in a burnt taste of the coffee if left unattended for long enough.
My educated guess is that (due to the fact that ground coffee has a very large surface / very small particles) the coffee is burnt/ roasted even further at low temp.</p>

  the Dr. Oz show in 2012. The Dr. Oz show referred to it as “The green
  coffee bean that burns fat fast” and claims that no exercise or diet
  is needed. How does it work? Green coffee beans are coffee beans that
  have not yet been roasted. These coffee beans contain a higher amount
  of the chemical chlorogenic acid. This chemical is thought to have
  health benefits. For high blood pressure it might affect blood vessels
  so that blood pressure is reduced.</p>
  
  <p>For weight loss, chlorogenic acid in green coffee is thought to affect
  how the body handles blood sugar and metabolism.</p>

2454,2,,2016-01-25T22:19:18.670,1,,"<p>There are several coffee varieties that have a ""sweeter"" taster. 
Varieties that have a delicate taste like Rhume Sudan, Geisha, Villa Sarchi, Montecristo, Bourbon, Maragogype will produce a sweeter cup when you apply a softer extraction (like a V60), and you use a light roast and natural or whiney processing. 
However, as stated on another answer, coffee has very low calories and contains very few sugars, beside trace leftovers from the fruit during processing.  So don't expect a strong sweet taster, but rather a very subtle reminder of sweetness. </p>

2456,2,,2016-01-26T00:55:28.743,4,,"<p>Well first off what is your definition of ristretto? It's very frequently misunderstood to mean simply a short shot of espresso, when really it's all about your coffee to yield ratio. Ristretto styled shots range somewhere in the 1:1 to 1:1.5 range (arguably). For example if you put in 18 grams of coffee, and then yield out 20 grams of espresso (1:1.1)- then you are somewhere in the land of ristretto. </p>

<p>What does this mean as far as caffeine goes? There is no difference at all. Whether you are pulling a normale or a ristretto shot, you still want an extraction somewhere around 20% of the original coffee mass. This means that you are extracting the exact same amount of coffee, but simply putting that into a smaller amount of water.</p>

<p>The other thing to look at is that caffeine is one of the first compounds that is extracted in the extraction process. So even if you decided to pull the shot a bit short and under extract it, you should still have the same caffeine content.</p>

<p>I'm sorry I have no sources or citation. I hope this helps!</p>

2457,2,,2016-01-26T01:03:18.177,1,,"<p>A darker coffee will be much more soluble - and extract much faster than a lighter roasted coffee. Coarsen your grind, use a lower water temperature (around 200F or wait about 45 seconds off boil), and use a quicker brew time. I would use a heavier coffee-to-water brew ratio, and extract less than you normally would. Something like 1-parts coffee to 16-parts water (1:16).</p>

<p>If you struggle to find any sort of sweetness from your coffee - then it may simply be too dark and burnt, to which there are no sugars left to develop. </p>

<p>My office is currently in a temporary building that is powered by a generator. Once a week, they shut off our power to refuel the generator. Every week when the power is out, I make a pot of coffee in our commercial ""drip"" coffee maker and often get weird looks for making coffee with no electricity. This only works because the water overflows out of the tank with the heating element and drips over the coffee grounds. As long as the heating coils are still hot and I use the heated water out of our water dispenser, I get hot coffee out of the machine at 180 to 190 degrees F. Using cold water in this type of coffee maker always results in colder brewed coffee. </p>

<p>For the ""geyser"" type maker, not all the water reaches the point of saturated steam. It is possible for the water to be unevenly heated and the small steam bubbles push liquid up to the top of the coffee maker. The same effect can be achieved with air bubbles in an airlift pump. It is possible to get slightly lower temperature out of one of these makers using cold water. </p>

<p>I use an electric drip brewer that has a built-in blade grinder with a reusable basket filter.

Then I put the filter back into the coffee maker and start brewing.</p>

<p>I'm not clear on the science behind why this works, but I think it has to do with preventing over-extraction. Basically, the fine powdery bean dust gets rinsed into the sink instead of going into the carafe (where it would continue to brew). This pre-rinse eliminates the oily surface and bitter smell that the coffee has. Plus, I no longer get an upset stomach that unrinsed coffee usually gives me.</p>

<p>However there is an effect that improve them at first, simply because some of the processes from the roasting takes time to finish, and may require several days in order to do so. They may even require exposure to air (oxygen) in order to oxidise some of the compounds causing the flavour. Keep in mind that even though <em>some</em> of the compounds improve, other does not. The most notable degradation in the first days is caused by the most volatile aroma compounds evaporating.</p>

2500,2,,2016-02-05T22:29:30.230,4,,"<p>Here's a few more things to add to @fredley's answer.</p>

<p>Since the water is going to be in contact with the grounds for a longer time (1- using greater volume of water, and 2- Chemex filter will be slower) you're going to get more of the bitter notes that you get (in general) by using a longer brewing time. Acidity will be offset somewhat by the bitterness. I find Chemex to be like a filter-coffee version of the body of a French Press preparation, though with no sediment. Compared to the throughput of V60 filters, @fredley hit it on the nose.</p>

<p>Though you are asking about taste specifically, there are other factors.</p>

<p>Like @fredley said, the filter paper in Chemex is <em>much</em> thicker and water drains through it <em>significantly</em> more slowly. You'll probably want to use a coarser grind (and very even grind) than you would for V60 or Melitta-style filters. Fines are the enemy of Chemex, causing the filter to clog and welling (see <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/why-does-the-filtrate-sometimes-well-up-in-the-upper-cone-when-using-the-chemex"">this question about ""welling up"" in a Chemex</a> for more on that). Certainly use the best burr grinder you can and don't delay in the pouring action.</p>

<p>Technique is ""more important"" (read as: ""finicky"") with Chemex, I think, than other pour-over systems.

<p>Mostly the flavor of coffee will either improve or stay the same within the first couple weeks of it's roast date. Coffee should generally degas a bit before brewing &amp; drinking (which it will degas with the bag open or closed). But by opening the bag you will indeed increase the degassing rate, which will change the flavor of the coffee when brewing. Which is a great thing until it starts to get old. I wouldn't take the graph in the other post to heart - it's really not to scale. Most light roasted coffees, and especially africans, may often taste at their peak around 10 days off roast. It's even more present when using them for espresso. </p>

Two contact points that might squeak are <strong><em>the burrs</em></strong> themselves and <strong><em>the top part of the crank rod</em></strong>. The good news is that the whole thing dis-/re-assembles rather easily, and in fact this is pretty much necessary for changing the coarseness setting. I'd suggest two possibilities based on my own Hario manual grinder. </p>

<ul>
<li>If the ceramic burrs are squeaking, <strong>try grinding some very dark-roast beans</strong> (E.g., French roast), which will have more oils on the surface than lighter-roast beans. Use a setting about as coarse as for drip coffee. This will naturally lubricate the bits that are rubbing together, and should reduce or eliminate the squeaking. I wouldn't recommend putting any (other) oil on the burr mechanism.</li>
<li>If the crank is squeaking, take the top part of the crank apart as you would to change the coarseness setting. Remove the coarseness adjustment nut (looks like a toothed gear) completely. <strong>Oil the shaft and the top of the post through which the rod passes</strong>, and make sure the oil is well distributed through the parts where the rod contacts. For the oil, I recommend using a food-grade mineral oil that you are comfortable with. Use a very small amount of oil (like a pinhead size drop in total). I wouldn't use a vegetable oil because it could become ""gummy"" or go rancid, and I wouldn't use anything non food-safe (e.g., not machine oil, not WD-40).</li>

We just run straight distilled white vinegar through ours to do so. Running the machine with distilled water rather than tap water helps keep mineral deposits to a minimum.</p>

<p>Also, running it without water can create an airlock (which makes it take a while for the water to pull through), and allows the pump to spin freely, and so can wreak havoc on, or at least weaken the pump. (I don't know what specific pump is employed by your machine, but <a href=""https://keithspecialty.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/can-i-damage-my-pump-if-i-run-out-of-water/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this page</a> may apply.) </p>

<p>Moreover, in the event that the pump has become weakened, it can be helpful to keep the reservoir completely full of water. I do not believe that a normally working machine would be affected too much by the grinding coarseness selected. </p>

<p>When deciding what to use, it may be to one's advantage to research whether the product is under warranty, and what the specific manufacturer recommends. Also, take into consideration that the unlisted chemicals that might be found in a given solution could put off foul odors and/or flavors (not that vinegar makes a good perfume, by any means).</p>

If you are gearing up for a long car ride, the flavor will degrade somewhat faster in a plastic container, but that wouldn't affect the decision for me. If you've ever been in a Flying J, you probably know that truck drivers almost invariably fill huge plastic mugs with coffee. As far as the caffeine levels, that might be affected slightly (on microscopic levels) depending on how long you keep it in there. The slightly more porous plastic will accumulate infinitesimal quantities of coffee on the sides, which is why plastic typically stains faster than glass or metal. </p>

<p>Sounds like the pump is not strong enough to push water through the puck.  Rather than set-and-forget on the finest it can do, you should be adjusting the grind constantly: after every shot if it ran longer than 25 seconds (to get 30ml) make the coffee a little bit more coarse, if shorter than 25s then make the coffee a little finer.  Every new batch of coffee beans you'll need to run a couple of shots, and perhaps make big changes, to re-calibrate to the nature of the new beans.</p>

<p>Factors that play into this equation include:</p>

<ul>
<li>how much coffee you put into the basket (more coffee requires a coarser grind)</li>
<li>how hard you tamped it (packing it harder invites a coarser grind)</li>
<li>how fresh the beans are (as they age they dry out, inviting a finer grind as they age)</li>
<li>how oily or dry the beans appear to be ('shiny' roasts tend to invite a coarser grind than ones where the surface of the beans appears light and dry)</li>
<li>humidity (dry air helps the grinder get a fine grind, so dry air invites a coarser grinder setting, humid air invites a finer setting on the grinder)</li>

2516,2,,2016-02-10T07:59:46.457,7,,"<p>For the LIDO grinders, burr drag, grinding, or touching is likely due to <strong><em>misalignment</em></strong>. Misalignment is more likely an <em>assembly</em> issue than a manufacturing issue since the burrs are machined. This means you can fix your Orphan Espresso LIDO on your own, with some handiwork and know-how.</p>

<p>When I received my Lido E, the burrs would contact each other at anything tighter than +3.5 on the adjustment ring. After careful realignment, I got down to -5 from ""factory-zero"" before any contact, fixing a misalignment of over eight notches! -5 is now my new ""recalibrated zero"".</p>

<p>My burrs are now much better centered than when it arrived, and I can get them extremely close together while keeping them fully free spinning.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npVWLJnBcAs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Orphan Espresso's LIDO Maintenance Video</a> is a detailed guide on how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble your LIDO. He only goes as far as to <em>approximately</em> realign the burrs.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGO_Onbx0NI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Orphan Espresso's LIDO Grider Burr Alignment Video</a>, he focuses on burr alignment, going more in-depth. The video is very informative, but I believe alignment can be improved further with these additional steps:</p>

<p><strong>To Perfectly Align LIDO 2, LIDO 3, or LIDO E Burrs</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Do as he instructs in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGO_Onbx0NI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the alignment video</a> until 7:24

<ul>
<li>He will:

<ol>
<li>Tighten one adjustment screw while grinder is upside down</li>
<li>Turn the grinder right side up</li>
<li>Fully tighten all screws in opposing X-order</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Instead, I suggest:

<ol>
<li>Keep grinder upside down</li>
<li>Lightly &amp; evenly tighten all adjustment screws in opposing X-order</li>
<li>The hopper should be lightly secured, locking in the outer burr's alignment</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Turn the LIDO right side up and loosen the adjustment ring until the burrs spin freely when the locking ring is locked.</li>
<li>Slowly tighten the adjustment ring (and re-lock) bit by bit, turning the handle a full circle and testing for burr contact.</li>
<li>When the first burr contact occurs, note the clock position of contact (e.g. 3 o'clock)</li>
<li>Slowly tighten an alignment screw at either the same or the opposing clock position (e.g. either 3 or 9 o'clock) until burr spins freely again.

<ul>
<li>It will take some experimentation to figure out which screw to tighten.</li>
<li>Sometimes, you may need to slightly loosen a screw to free the burr.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If all alignment screws are as snug as possible without introducing more burr contact, you're done. Otherwise, go back to step 4.</li>
</ol>

<p>If done correctly, the burrs will be so well-centered that when tightening the adjustment ring until first burr contact, the burr contacts in two or more (or all) places at once. The point of first burr contact is your new ""recalibrated zero"".</p>

<p><strong>What this is doing</strong></p>

<p>The alignment video shows how to align the inner burr and outer burr before screwing in the alignment screws. The problem is that I found the burrs can still get misaligned during tightening of the alignment screws.</p>

<p>My procedure addresses those last 1-2 turns of the alignment screws, between ""lightly"" and ""fully"" tightened. Slowly tightening whilst rechecking alignment makes sure that everything stays aligned even as the screws are fully tightened.</p>

They are a bit different, and I use both the metal disk and paper filter based on my mood. To my taste, <strong>the metal disk does produce a ""fuller"" bodied cup</strong> (because more ""stuff"" comes through the filter -- oils and macro-particles or whatever). I believe that ""an average user"" (by my definition) would be able to tell the difference in a side-by-side test, and probably enough to determine preference.</p>

<p>That said, <strong><em>I prefer the paper for a few reasons</em></strong>.</p>

<p>First, the <strong><em>simple convenience</em></strong> is better for me. After brewing, I plunge the filter and spent grounds directly into my compost container. After a quick rinse of the unit, it's clean enough for me.</p>

<p>As for my (personal) taste and preferences, <strong><em>I think the paper produces a better quality and more enjoyable cup.</em></strong> Since the perforations are larger, there is more grit in the output when using the metal disk, so you end up with a (small amount) of ""sludge"" in the bottom of your cup, and it will turn bitter more quickly because of longer contact with the grounds after brewing.</p>

<p>As an aside, I also prefer it for the marginal (and debatable) ""health"" reasons. Paper filters remove some compounds (such as cafestol) that have purported cholesterol-affecting properties.

<p>A strange question and purely hypothetical. This came about with a discussion with one of my friends who is a glass maker at university.</p>

<p>My first thoughts was that you could not control the temperature enough, however he did state that with glass making, the art is in how fast you can heat and cool down the kiln. So in effect, I don't think the temperature control would be an issue. I feel my issues are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rotating of the coffee
during the roasting (as it would not be in a drum). It's possible to ""spin"" glass in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_casting_(mirrors)"" rel=""noreferrer"">this

<li>Post roast cooling, would there be a way you could make a makeshift
cooling bed that would be somewhat effective.</li>

<p>""Drinkable"" on the other hand is a hard to quantify term.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would roast the raw beans slowy until 200 - 230 C over a time window of 15 - 25 minutes, depending on desired darkness and roast type. 
This allows for a long and slow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction"" rel=""nofollow"">Maillard reaction</a> and reduces the content of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogenic_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">chlorogenic acid</a>.<br>

<p>Here are the instructions from <a href=""http://www.seriouseats.com/user/profile/nickcho"">Nick Cho</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Start with a very coarse grind, maybe at the coarsest setting on your grinder. The particles should appear somewhere between coarse
  salt and steelcut oats. Take note of your grind size so you can make
  adjustments later: grind a little finer next time if your brew was
  weak, a bit coarser if you're tasting a lot of unpleasant, dish-raggy,
  overextracted flavors.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>How much:</strong> While there's a maximum amount that your French press will make, there isn't really a minimum. A good coffee-to-water ratio
  is between 60-70 grams of coffee per liter of water (a mass ratio
  between 1:16 and 1:14). Decide how much brewed coffee you want to make
  and weigh out the right amount of coffee.</p>
  
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li><p>Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready. With French press, you're good to pour your water right off the boil unless
  you've got an insulated (or double-walled) press, in which case you
  should wait about 30 seconds off of boil. If you're brewing
  dark-roasted coffee or decaf, it's better with water about 10 to 15°F
  lower.</p></li>
  <li><p>Start your clock and add your water. Some people like to add a little water, stir, and add the rest. It really doesn't matter. The
  important part is what you do after you add the water. If you were to
  just sit back and wait out your brew time now, you'd have an
  under-extracted brew, because the release of CO2 gas will cause your
  grounds to rise up and float on top of your water. Remember that first
  phase ""Wetting?"" Well, if you don't have good wetting, you don't have
  much of anything that follows, so you should give your coffee and
  water mix a gentle but thorough stir at about 30 to 45 seconds in.
  You'll know you're good to put the lid on and move on to the next step
  when most of the coffee has sunk and isn't floating anymore.</p></li>
  <li><p>This may be very different from what you've heard before, but bear with me: shoot for a target brew time between <strong>6 and 8 minutes</strong>. ""What?
  I thought it was 3 to 4 minutes!"" you might say. You can brew in 3 to
  4 minutes if you want, but to get good flavor results, you'd be
  grinding a lot finer, and you're not getting the most out of the
  unique qualities of the French press. Give 6 to 8 minutes a try with
  the coarse grind, and see if you can dial that in.</p></li>
  <li><p>When you're ready to stop your brewing, it's time to plunge. So as I've mentioned, French press is a nice, slow, gentle brew. One great
  way to ruin that niceness would be to violently agitate your coffee
  grounds, accelerating extraction right at the end when your coffee has
  already given up the good stuff and the bitter and astringent negative
  flavors are in danger of taking over. Plunge gently. If you feel the
  plunger start to get tight, back it up an inch or two and resume
  plunging. Once you get to the bottom, you're done!</p></li>
  <li><p>If you've plunged your bed down nice and tight, there isn't a lot of brewing that will happen from this point on, but it's still ideal
  to pour off your entire beverage right after plunging to truly stop
  the brewing process.</p></li>

<p>But there are some Cons of Drinking Coffee</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The potential health benefits of drinking coffee are exciting news, but that doesn’t mean more is better. For some people, coffee can
  cause irritability, nervousness or anxiety in high doses, and it can
  also impact sleep quality and cause insomnia. In people with
  hypertension, coffee consumption does transiently raise their blood
  pressure–although for no more than several hours–but no correlation
  has been found between coffee drinking and long-term increases in
  blood pressure or the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients
  with pre-existing hypertension.</p>
  
  <p>Caffeine affects every person differently, so if you experience any
  negative side effects, consider cutting your coffee consumption
  accordingly. It takes about six hours for the effects of caffeine to
  wear off, so limit coffee drinking to early in the day, or switch to
  decaf, which only contains about 2 to 12 mg of caffeine per eight
  ounces. Always taper your coffee consumption gradually. Avoid quitting
  coffee cold turkey; doing so can lead to caffeine withdrawal symptoms
  that may include severe headache, muscle aches and fatigue which can
  last for days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To Keep it Healthy</strong>  Skip the fat-filled, sugar-laden coffeehouse beverages and order a basic black coffee. Alternatively, switch to skim milk or unsweetened soy or nut milk.</p>

<li>Different beans (2 different bags of fresh preground ground coffee, with both ""standard for cafetiere grind"" and espresso grinds).  Grinding at work is not an option and doing at home is too annoying.</li>

<li>Washing the paper filter before use (I dont do this at home normally)</li>
<li>Using the inverted method (with the same, or slightly less grounds)</li>
<li>Using another breakout area (with the same system) in case the normal one is broken/dirty/etc</li>

<p>Aside from temperature (which you should check - it's OK if it's cooler, but too cool is no good, and knowing the temperature will help you modify other parameters), it's important to have high quality, odour-free water that is free from impurities and that has the correct mineral content. The SCAA actually specifies water standards (see <a href=""https://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;d=water-standards"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). In many developed parts of the world, tap water is fine. However, demineralised water is NOT fine. It will underextract.</p>

<p>One solution*: Buy bottled mineral water (like Evian or a cheaper alternative), which usually has too HIGH a mineral content, and blend it with the filtered water from the dispenser. This may seem hard core, but it'd be good as an experiment to see if it cures your woes.</p>

Regardless of if it is a storage type or on demand type system, it may require cleaning.  Storing water at temperature has a tendency to cause the contained minerals to accumulate in the container.

<p>Additional information on the chemistry of coffee taste. This is produced by what we know as the Maillard Reaction -  the Maillard Reaction (MRx). Discovered by a French chemist in 1910 the MRx is what is largely responsible for transforming the mere handful of compounds found in green coffee (unroasted) to the complex aromatic beverage that it is today. As temperatures reach 150°C (302°F) the MRx causes free proteins to combine with sugars to form aromatic compounds such as furans which impart sweet, caramel like notes to the coffee. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/mWOtZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>:</p>

2551,2,,2016-02-18T03:41:23.970,1,,"<p><strong>I think you are attempting to brew with water that is way too cold.</strong> To me, this is the elephant in the room in your question.</p>

<p>Though it's only an anecdote (until you measure your water temperature!) I myself measured the ""very hot"" water taps from a filter machine and from a hot water dispenser in my office: one was 75°C and one was 85°C. The latter is actually the hot water dispenser from a coffee-brewing machine. Both of these are way below what I consider to be adequate brewing temperature (~95°C). I did as fair of a measurement as I could: reasonably calibrated instant-read thermometer, pouring water directly from the tap directly over the thermometer into a pre-heated mug.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2019/what-water-temperature-and-pour-speed-are-best-for-pour-over-method"">this question about pour-over temperatures</a> and links from (full disclosure) my answer there.</p>

<p>It's also striking how quickly water cools: merely traveling through the air when pouring from a vessel can make the water drop a few degrees C. I think you will probably need a separate heating kettle, and I don't think you should ever expect to have to cool off water before brewing.</p>

<p>Or, like I said before in my original comment: measure the temperature and prove me wrong!</p>

<p>So coffee quality is often measured according to the standards of the CQI (Coffee Quality Institute) that produces the Q grader certification. Graders taste the coffee and score it on many metrics before putting the score as a number between one and one hundred. Traditionally 80+ was considered the threshold for 'specialty' coffee. But there are many, many kinds of coffee that make it to 80+ - all great but in different ways. </p>

2554,2,,2016-02-19T16:59:13.343,1,,"<p>The bitter compounds in coffee are less soluble in water than the other flavor compounds we like, so we can use that to keep the bitterness to a minimum.  In brewing; water temperature, length of contact with the grinds, and fineness of ground are the main factors you can control to keep bitterness to a minimum.  Here are a few explanations that might help:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hotter water will dissolve all the compounds more quickly, including the bitter ones.  Make sure your water is ""off the boil"", meaning somewhere between 195-205F.  This will mean the bitter notes will dissolve into the brew more slowly.  This is good.  Along these lines, one thing I've discovered is that using less water means the grounds will cool off the water more and they can steep for longer without producing bitterness.  </p></li>
<li><p>Finer ground means more of the bitter compounds are in direct contact with the water so a slightly more coarse grind can reduce bitterness as well, all other things being equal.</p></li>
<li><p>The longer hot water is in contact with the grounds, the more the bitterness will come out.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>To answer your question directly, just splitting your batch won't help without one of these modifications.  Without seeing your method directly I would offer these suggestions.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take care with your water temperature.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider only pouring a portion of the water over the grounds, like maybe half, to two thirds, then just pouring the rest of the water into the concentrated coffee.  Less water through the coffee.  This is essentially how an AeroPress works.  When I've brewed the same coffee with an AeroPress vs. pour over, the pour over definitely comes out more bitter when I pour all the water through the grounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Try a coarser grind.</p></li>
<li><p>Try a combination of these, such as a slightly coarser grind, pouring only 2/3 of the water through, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One thing I haven't mentioned is to make sure you're using good coffee beans, not roasted too dark.  The darker the roast, the more bitter the coffee.  I've found French and Italian roasts to be entirely too bitter for my taste.  </p>

<p>Anyhow, just be careful not to be over-extracting. If your coffee beans can handle that amount of water without over-extraction (which results in excessive bitterness because of burned-down oils, and possibly too much caffeine), great. Some beans do, some don't.</p>

According to the book on coffee that I have (from 2014), Brazil is the leading producing country for coffee in terms of <strong>volume</strong> - it produces 35% of the coffee sold worldwide.  The have many different areas of production, which produce a variety of beans (80% Arabica, 20% Robusta), using a variety of different bean processing techniques. Brazil has some regions in which the harvest can be performed by machines, and others where this does not work so well. So in terms of coffee production, they have pretty much every coffee type and preparation type that exists. Given how large the country is, that's not exactly surprising.</p>

<p>If you see a coffee marketed as being from Brazil, this is most likely to distinguish the coffee from the cheaper brands that mix all kinds of coffee from different parts of the world. A lot of specialty beans are actually sold in single-origin packs. </p>

<p>Having said that, my coffee book singles out coffee from the ""Sul De Minas"" region as one where the beans taste have a fine fruity flavor. Also, ""Icatu"" is a brazilian Robusta cross-over variety that has strong flavor. </p>

<p>Dry processing produces a coffee that IS different than most other processing methods. The coffee tends to roast differently and also produces much more chaff when roasting.  It also tends to have a different flavor profile than the same coffee processed differently.</p>

<p>Many countries or regions will espouse the benefits of their method of processing, but there are other factors that greatly affect the reasons for choosing a particular method.  High humidity or rainfall areas will generally have a hard time dry processing coffee.  More labor intensive methods may be unfavorable in areas where labor is not had cheaply.  Water intensive methods will be undesirable in frequent drought areas or areas where water is expensive.</p>

<p>Brazil is somewhat synonymous with dry processing.  My roaster has a line on it for ""Brazil"" coffee.  What it really means is dry processed coffee.  Filling the roaster with dry processed beans past the line will overload the unit's ability to get rid of chaff as fast as it is produced and ruin the roast.

2606,2,,2016-03-08T15:35:08.350,4,,"<p>TL;DR Silver skin is recycled/re-purposed coffee skin also called <em>coffee chaff</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before coffee beans are roasted they contain about 11% internal
  moisture, if you look at a green (unroasted) coffee bean next to a
  roasted one you will notice the green bean is much smaller and has a
  thin skin, called silverskin or chaff.</p>
  
  <p>The heat of the roasting process converts the internal moisture into
  steam causing the skin to heat up and the bean to expand. When
  roasting is completed the chaff falls off and is removed from the
  roaster. Like coffee, chaff contains a high nitrogen content which
  makes it a valuable product for environmental purposes, and each roast
  produces about 3.2 pounds of chaff. As part of our commitment to
  consciously great coffee we have found a way to recycle the chaff from
  every roast instead of tossing it into the dumpster. Since 2008 we
  have partnered with a company called Reconserve that converts bulk
  food waste materials into animal feed and who’s guiding philosophy is:
  recycle, reprocess, resource conservation. Reconserve picks the chaff
  up from our roasting facility in Sacramento, blends it with other
  bakery byproducts, and produces a feed supplement for dairy cows. We
  currently produce about 4,000 pounds of chaff each month, this means
  since 2008 we have recycled about 320,000 pounds of chaff into feed
  for cattle. We take our commitment to sustainability seriously and
  make sure that we are constantly evaluating every step of our process
  to see where we can make improvements. When you purchase ecoGrounds
  coffees we want you to know you are choosing a high quality coffee
  that has a positive impact on the environment and global community.</p>

2607,2,,2016-03-08T17:03:59.523,4,,"<p>Silver skin is the name generally used when it is still on the green beans.  This thin but tough layer is lightly colored (sometimes similarly to the paper product in your question) and mostly translucent.  It allows the green color of the bean underneath to be seen.  After roasting (when it begins to loosen and fall off) it is more properly called chaff.</p>

<p>Since the paper is likely made of chaff collected from the roasting process (easy to collect since nearly all roasters have a mechanism for separation) is actually an excellent reuse of chaff.  ""Chaff paper"" just doesn't have the same ring since generally chaff is thought to be a byproduct to be discarded.  </p>

<p>The silver skin is the innermost layer of the coffee cherry surrounding the pit/seed (green coffee bean).  It is a tough substance to remove and different processing techniques remove varying amounts (dry process coffee removes the least and dry process coffee produces the most chaff when roasting).  Roasting the coffee both dries the silver skin and causes it to split as the coffee bean expands, so it comes off fairly easily during the roasting process given some agitation.  </p>

2608,2,,2016-03-09T00:24:23.520,1,,"<p>I have the same grinder, and I find that the static builds up more with the amount you grind. For everyday AeroPress use, I don't grind enough per use for it to build up static, but when I cold brew a whole 12oz of coffee, I grind the whole bag in batches. This builds up a lot of static due the the bin being plastic, and it's annoying to clean as it flies all over the counter.</p>

<p><strong>I wouldn't recommend using water</strong> on the beans before grinding because even though the burr grinder is stainless steel, it is not rust-proof. So thinking long term, I would simply recommend keeping the batch size lower than the max line on the plastic bin. I wouldn't use water to clean the steel grinder either. Only use a brush and you can even pre-grind a tiny amount of throw-away grounds to clear the old grounds out.</p>

<p>A clean up is usually in the cards for when I make coffee anyways, and a little bit of grounds isn't going to trip me up, but I share your frustration.</p>

2609,2,,2016-03-09T00:41:35.897,3,,"<p>I used to do this for a co-worker and me. We'd use three AeroPress spoonfuls of coffee (which is a lot) to make two cups. I think the theory was that the saturation of that much coffee grounds in the small amount of water that took up what little room was left in the AeroPress chamber, was not efficient at all. So we'd brew the same grounds twice. This made for more bitter coffee, because the coffee was over extracted, and it pulled the tannins into solution.</p>

<p>We opted for simply letting the coffee brew longer and increasing pressure during the press to force extract more out of the grounds. This yielded a much stronger concentrate that we'd then dilute to normal coffee/water proportions. This created a delicious and full cup of coffee every time.  </p>

<p>I think for your case, you'd be brewing hours apart with the same grounds to save money, and I think you totally could. The issue I see is that most caffeine in coffee is extracted within seconds of brew time, so your second brew with those grounds may not yield a nicely drugged cup of joe. So not only will the taste be bitter, but it may also put you to sleep.</p>

Sugar-alternatives can help too (stevia, et al.).
But assuming you don't want to add anything to your straight black coffee, I would change what you have control over. Brewing method and coffee.</p>

<p>Cold brewing reduces acids extracted from the coffee, which reduces bitterness. AeroPress brewing extracts less than most other hot methods like a french press.</p>

<p>For coffee, try out light roast or medium roast coffees, as these will have less tannins. You should also try out dry-processed vs wet-processed coffees, as those methods introduce different flavors to the coffee. Most dry-processed coffee will have a more stone fruity flavor due the the sweet cascara fruit flesh drying onto the beans.</p>

2611,2,,2016-03-09T01:18:48.290,3,,"<p>The difference can be scoped purely to the side-effects of how the coffee is extracted. You can make up for most deficiencies from either method, by accommodating for it.</p>

<p><strong>Normal</strong> - starts dripping almost immediately, meaning some of the water didn't get a chance to extract.</p>

<p><strong>Inverted</strong> - you can let it brew for as long as you want.</p>

<p><strong>Normal</strong> - grounds fall to the bottom and create a self-filtering layer. This layer allows for proper pressure/extraction/etc.</p>

<p><strong>Inverted</strong> - as you flip and press you may not have allowed enough time for a layer to form and some of the grounds get stuck to the top - solution: after flipping, whirl the water to collect the stuck grounds and then wait a bit before pressing.</p>

<p>Essentially it's not really that Normal vs Inverted affects the taste directly, but rather what you do with that position of the AeroPress is what affects the taste.  Having the AeroPress inverted ensures that you are fully submerging the coffee in water which you can now label full immersion brewing. If you allowed the coffee to drain in ""normal"" orientation, you'd instead be essentially drip brewing at least a small part of the coffee. The effects on the resulting brew could be nominal and undetectable, but if you were to drastically change time/pressure/stirring/agitation/bloom/ratios <em>THAT</em> is when the resulting coffee taste would change.</p>

2617,2,,2016-03-10T16:34:30.490,4,,"<p>The differences are minor, but there are differences.  When brewing normally, water begins to drip through the paper filter immediately when poured over the grounds.  After stirring I usually have to add more water after the bloom recedes.  Inverted, all the water stays with the grounds until you flip it over and start extracting.  The extra water added with the normal process is hotter, and I believe will tend to over extract bitter notes more easily, not only because of the higher temperature, but by virtue of the added volume of water passing through the grounds.</p>

<p>Inverted, however, the volume of water is less, and because of that, the temperature of that water will be lowered a bit.  You can extract quickly, or wait as long as you want to extract the coffee.  Additionally, I have seen it claimed that with the inverted method, oils that will rise to the top of the column will be forced through the filter first and flavor the coffee more than with the regular method where they tend to get trapped in the grounds.  </p>

<p>I have gone back and forth but always seem to go back to the inverted method. It provides more control of the variables and for me gives a better flavor, even when using the same beans, same roast, same water temperature.  Your mileage may vary of course.   </p>

It took awhile but I'm enjoying really fresh quality coffee that exceeds anything I could buy, even ""fresh"" roasted beans.  My former non-coffee drinking wife has also become a recent convert, forcing me to double my roasting output.  </p>

<p>I expect that if I went with a larger roaster, I would have to go through a whole new learning curve though.  I probably ruined a pound of beans before I started getting drinkable coffee, and another pound after that before I hit the sweet spot.  It all really depends on how much you value really top quality taste.  </p>

First, make sure your water isn't too hot.  I've seen recommendations for as low as 185F which is far below boiling.  You would need a thermometer to accurately gauge the temperature, but at the very least make sure the water is well off the boil before you add it.  Second, don't leave the water on the grounds for too long.  The longer the water is brewing, the more bitter notes will be extracted.  Finally, a bit coarser grind might also help.  The usual recommendation is for something slightly finer than what you would use for drip brew.  You might try something slightly more coarse and see how that goes.  </p>

The brewing process is about extraction. The balance of sweet/bitter/tannin/acid/flavors can be affected by your brew process. I find that acids and fruit go hand in hand, and so the perception of the fruit flavors can be enhanced by acids. Doing a cold brew I find is amazing for dark roasts, because it subdues the acids, and the dark chocolate/woody flavors don't work as well with a lot of acids in my opinion. I believe an espresso brings out maximum acidity/brightness for any given coffee, and you get a lot of citrus notes, but that might be too bright to taste the sweet flavors you're looking for. That means you want something in the middle just erring on the side of bright. </p>

<p>I would recommend this: find a Panama (or other central/south American origin) dry-processed (aka ""natural"") and brew it with gentle pressure for sweetness.</p>

<p>Dry-processed/Natural coffees are dried out with fruit flesh on before its removal, which allows the sweetness and flavor of cascara fruit seep into the beans. Washed/Wet-processed coffees have their fruit flesh removed immediately, so they tend to have a cleaner coffee flavor.</p>

The oil here is used to glaze the beans, which would then mix consistently when ground and brewed.

<blockquote>
  <p>....The... beans are generally roasted in what is referred to as ""butter oil"", which may or may not be actual clarified butter oil. Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional ""home-grown"" coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process.</p>

<p>For those interested, my current espresso problems are as follows:</p>

<p>I manage to get the grind to a size where I'm noticing good thin mouse tail pours but the lack of thick, golden brown crema makes me think I can get a better shot.</p>

<p>I've read that light coloured crema or thin crema is a symptom of underextraction, depending on the length of the shot (where mine was in and around 20 seconds for a double shot, so relatively fast). I then ground finer and the extraction immediately changed. The mouse tails disappeared and the extraction was fast, almost instantly blonding within a second of the extraction. Liquid was not pouring out extremely fast but in comparison with the slower previous extraction it was relatively fast. I tried to continue to lower the grind size to attempt to slow the extraction but to no avail.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia explains it thus</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arabic coffee, or ‘‘Al-Qahwa’’ (Arabic: قهوة‎, qahwah, locally gahwah
  or g'hawah), is made from coffee beans roasted very lightly or heavily
  from 165 °C (329 °F) to 210 °C (410 °F) and cardamom, and is a
  traditional beverage in Arabian culture. Traditionally, it is roasted
  on the premises (at home or for special occasions), ground, brewed and
  served in front of guests. It is often served with dates, dried fruit,
  candied fruit or nuts. This brewing method is common in Najd and
  Hijaz, and sometimes other spices like saffron (to give it a golden
  color), cloves, and cinnamon. Some people add a little evaporated milk
  to slightly alter its color; however, this is rare. It is served from
  a special coffee pot called dallah (Arabic: دلة‎) and the coffee cups
  are small with no handle called fenjan. The portions are small,
  covering just the bottom of the cup.</p>

But as we all know, this makes the water flat (not to mention calcium build up in the tank) and there is insufficient contact to extract all the flavor from the coffee.

2665,2,,2016-03-26T20:02:10.017,5,,"<p>After some time has passed and no one answered, yet. Maybe I can come up with an answer. The question is not clear and if I understood correctly, the answer is too broad. Therefore, I will try to elaborate my answer by summarizing factors that effects <em>the tag</em> of the question.</p>

<p><em>Note: Please leave comments as this is a quite broad answer.</em></p>

<p><strong>The species</strong></p>

<p>When we say coffee, we mention two different species of <em>Coffea</em> Genus. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_arabica"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffea arabica</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea_canephora"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffea canephora</a> (aka robusta). They have many differences. Shortly, Arabica grows in the mountains, more expensive and has more oil (so flavor), less caffeine. Robusta grows in the seaside, less expensive and has less oil (so flavor), more caffeine. More detailed discussion can be followed under <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/116/what-is-the-difference-between-robusta-and-arabica"">this question</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The origin</strong></p>

<p>You grow this plant in different places. Location and cultivation affects the taste. So, the origin has effects on the flavor. You may hear ""Ethiopian arabica"" or ""Indonesian robusta"" quite often.</p>

<p><strong>The blend</strong></p>

<p>So, it comes the blend. After the harvest, the fruits are collected, dried and the beans are picked. When you collect different beans from all over the world, you blend them. Sometimes, single origin beans are used to taste the flavor as it is. Sometimes, they are blended to mix the effect of a variety of beans. Blends may be all arabica, all robusta or mixed.</p>

<p><strong>The Roast</strong></p>

<p>After the blend is prepared, roasting starts. During roasting normally up to 15% of the beans weight is dried out. This process is one of the main decisions based on personal preference, blend structure and the targeted drink. A list of coffee roast varieties can be found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Note that there are also unlisted very very light roasts as in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2432/how-to-create-green-coffee"">green coffee</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The grind</strong></p>

<p>Grinding is also closely related to the targeted drink. For example, the coffee must be as fine as powder for preparing Turkish coffee. On the other hand, such fine grinding is so unpractical in French press as the grains could easily travel through the filter.</p>

<p><strong>The Brew</strong></p>

<p>Choose a brewing method. As a subtitle, use proper equipment for that method. Master your brewing method. Needless to say, there are (probably) hundreds of them. I could enlist three main methods as: pressurized extraction, thermal extraction, and cold-brew methods.</p>

<p><strong>The service</strong></p>

<p>According to a questionnaire, baristas in Italy state that even pouring the espresso may affect the flavor. Apart from that, it is a known fact that the espresso cups must be pre-heated for a better experience. So, even serving the coffee is important.</p>

<p><strong>The freshness</strong></p>

<p>As a bonus article to the aforementioned ones, freshness. One should take car of the freshness of the coffee at each step. The beans themselves must not wait for years. After roasting, they should be degassed for two to three days before grinding. However, they should be consumed right after the grinding. There is a famous expression on that: <em>the customer not the espresso must wait</em>. In one experiment it is shown that, if one day old ground coffee is used, the foam volume of espresso is 35% less than the one prepared by freshly ground coffee.</p>

2667,2,,2016-03-27T18:54:10.010,3,,"<p>Proper size of cezve matters. Normally, it is ideal to fill up the cezve up to one third to the half of its height before beginning the brewing process. You need the rest of the height during the foaming time. You cannot fill it up to the neck and start brewing. In that case, at the end, when bubbles start to appear, it will spill over.</p>

<p>In Turkey, cezve is usually sold in sets. You can see a set of old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves in the image below. This set includes 1-cup to 5-cup cezves. However, I don't recommend them as the metal is not thick, so the heat is not homogeneously distributed while brewing. A second disadvantage is, tin plating could be worn away in time and copper oxidizes easily. The green colored copper-oxide is quite poisonous.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/94ZTc.jpg"" alt=""Old style tin-plated copper set of five cezves""></a></p>

<p>A modern stainless steel cezve set is also shown below. (Image is copied from Hisar cutlery firm's website.) This set includes 2-cup to 4-cup cezves.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9on3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9on3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, both sets include different sized cezves for different servings.</p>

<p><em>(A distinct advantage of possessing more than one cezve at home has another advantage: You may prepare Turkish coffee with or without sugar at the same time in two different cezves in case your guest wants to consume a different recipe than yours.)</em></p>

<p>So, I assume I make my point that the size matters and also the count is important. Let's talk about the shape.</p>

<p>Be practical, see inside. Check the spoon for stirring in the second image. You can see its length is ideal for stirring without burning your hand. Your hand will be over the vaporizing coffee most of the time. Find your ideal spoon, together with your cezve.</p>

<p>As it can clearly be seen, the shape is more or less the same. Wider bottom is mostly a result of finding proper balance on top of the stoves for small sized ones. You can see it when you look at them in the sets next to each other. If the bottom is wider, the neck seems narrower. When you have heavier stainless steel cezves, balance is already there, so the bottom is not that wider, thus the neck is not that narrower.</p>

<p>Still, I must admit that, a narrow neck is also related with the foam. The foam is formed by carbon dioxide packed in coffee lipids. When you heat the coffee, the carbon dioxide is extracted together with lipids and cannot be solved after some threshold in water. Those carbon dioxide changes its phase to gas form such as any effervescent, forming bubbles. This is the foam of Turkish coffee. If you try to brew Turkish coffee in a pan, the bubbles will be too far away and cannot survive in the surface of the coffee. They will soon pop and fade away. If they are close together, some irregularities of coffee (such as small particles in the coffee powder) stick on the surface of the bubbles and keep them together. Then, the bubbles form the foam. That's the reason a narrow neck helps to keep the foam.</p>

Unless the coffee has been stored improperly until today (stored in a moist environment with light, exposure to elements, etc.) I would think it would be okay to drink. Coffee is all about taste; to another person, old coffee will taste flat and not have such an aromatic flavor as freshly ground coffee.</p>

<p>The main reason people get sleepy after eating large meals, ""get the 'itis"" as many call it, simply has to do with homeostasis. The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: <a href=""http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars).</p>

<p>Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals!</p>

<p>Now, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant. It increases blood pressure, metabolism, causes natriuresis (increase in saline secretion), but most obviously, may cause jitteriness, mild anxiety and alertness.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Pharmacodynamics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This is because when caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.</a></p>

<p><strong>It is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapses</strong>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/r7mcd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> After eating, your body is naturally producing neurotransmitters to bring your body to a state of homeostasis. When you ingest coffee, which contains caffeine, it counteracts this and keeps you awake and alert.</p>

<p>Caffeine is mainly used to boost awareness and caffeine can be found in a variety of drinks. Caffeine alone is very effective at perking a person up but if paired with sugar this can have a double ""energy effect since the sugar will also increase energy levels...but sugar will also cause a ""sugar crash"" (that is another topic, regarding insulin/glucose levels in the blood.)</p>

<p>So lets say you don't drink large doses of caffeine on a regular basis and you want to try and drink this famous ""cup of Joe"" from Starbucks, what could go wrong? well it all depends on your caffeine tolerance. Just like a habitual user of nicotine or other stimulating drugs will be affected differently, a caffein user will tolerate different levels of a cup of joe depending on their weight, liver function to metabolize the caffeine and how much water you drink + kidney function. </p>

<p>Caffeine is a drug:</p>

<p>Caffeine is no more different than nicotine or cocaine, Why? because caffeine is considered a stimulant very much like nicotine and cocaine, it produces very similar effects thus some of the side effects may be similar as well. Also, caffeine is habit forming and a person can become dependent or addicted to it, resulting in withdrawal symptoms when coming off it.</p>

<p><em>Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.[10] It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but — unlike many other psychoactive substances — it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. There are several known mechanisms of action to explain the effects of caffeine. The most prominent is that it reversibly blocks the action of adenosine on its receptor and consequently prevents the onset of drowsiness induced by adenosine. Caffeine also stimulates certain portions of the autonomic nervous system.</em> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine</a></p>

<p><em>Nicotine acts as both a stimulant and a sedative. Immediately after exposure to nicotine, there is a ""kick"" caused in part by the drug's stimulation of the adrenal glands and resulting discharge of epinephrine (adrenaline). The rush of adrenaline stimulates the body, causing a sudden release of glucose as well as an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and respiration. Nicotine also suppresses insulin output from the pancreas, causing smokers to be slightly hyperglycemic. In addition, nicotine indirectly causes a release of dopamine in the brain regions that control pleasure and motivation. This reaction is similar to that seen with other abused drugs—such as cocaine and heroin—and is thought to underlie the pleasurable sensations many smokers experience. In contrast, nicotine can also exert a sedative effect, depending on the level of the smoker's nervous system arousal and the dose of nicotine taken.</em>

Up to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two ""energy shot"" drinks. Although caffeine use may be safe for adults, it's not a good idea for children.</p>

<p>So there are several problems with that taste-wise in espresso. The resistance is now not in the ground coffee itself, but below it. Additionally, if your coffee is ground finely and uniformly in a good espresso grinder (as one would for a non-pressurized portafilter), this sort of portafilter will result in too much resistance and thus a slow, over-extracted shot. It can also make your crema look a bit odd because it can emulsify some of the oils in your extracted shot (depending on the design of the specific portafilter).</p>

<p>Essentially the requisite grind size to produce acceptable espresso using a pressurized portafilter is much larger than that of optimal or delicious espresso.</p>

<p>This sort of portafilter does have its upsides, though. If you don't have access to a quality espresso grinder, and you are using either store-ground beans or imprecisely/more coarsely ground beans, a pressurized portafilter can make acceptable espresso from them whereas the results in a standard portafilter would be very watery and underextracted.</p>

  <p><strong>Salt and Coffee:</strong> Not only does salt cut the bitterness of coffee, but it also smooths out the “stale” taste of tank-stored water. I’ve taken to adding a quarter teaspoon of kosher salt to every 6 tablespoons of grounds. That isn’t really enough to taste, but it’ll do the trick.

<p>The reason has to do with the different way we absorb caffeine when chewed rather than brewed.</p>

<p>When drinking coffee, the caffeine has to be digested and absorbed through your stomach lining, duodenum, or small intestine (I'm not sure which.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, when chewing on a bean, the caffeine is directly absorbed by your mouth into the bloodstream. Therefore even a single bean, which may have 1/10 or less caffeine than a cup, will give you a boost. It will give it sooner, usually while you're still chewing on it, but it will go away sooner too. (Unless you eat a large number of beans. Don't do that.)</p>

2704,2,,2016-04-10T02:17:50.637,2,,"<p>There are at least three ways to reduce acidity.</p>

<p>One way is to roast the beans more, to a dark level. I think that is the main way if you want to stick with your beans. This is inline with <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2570/how-best-to-reduce-tannins-in-black-coffee/2571#2571"">MT San's comment and related answer</a>.</p>

<p>A second way is to play with the speed of dripping. The idea is to find a speed of water flowing through the coffee ground that gives better results (depending on your goal---here lower acidity). A slower water flow will keep the ground longer, so extract or destruct more compounds---thus a different flavour. In my limited experiments here, faster flow brings more acidity. But I am not confident on the generality of this result.</p>

<p>An alternative, when you are fine with changing beans, is to get a variety or a blend that results in lower acidity. This is not as efficient as a dark roast, but you can get more flavours and variations. Roasting artisans should be able to offer good candidates.</p>

<p>There may be other ways, but I have no other experience.</p>

<h3>Later...</h3>

<p>Thanks to @Chris_in_AK, I have recalled another alternative: Cold-brew. The question refers to ""drip-brew"", so cold-brew is border-line, but it is technically a drip, with cold water, so here it is.</p>

<p>Cold brew allows to extract very different flavour profiles. The slow, soft process takes ages (8 to 12 hours), for often surprising results. And warming up the result leads to yet again different flavours.</p>

<p>In my experience, drinks are less acid with coffee brew. I do not use a wide range of beans, so please keep in mind that this claim may depend on the species. Also, the roast level leads to different results---exactly as a hot-water drip does.</p>

<p>Cold brew emphasizes ""green"" or ""herbal"" notes, though. It is, I believe, worth a try as acidity is different, but it is yet different from ""usual coffee drinks"". Well, production is hard too.</p>

2706,2,,2016-04-10T19:21:00.847,10,,"<p>The process of compressing the coffee powder in a portafilter of an espresso machine before pulling the shot is called <strong>tamping</strong>. There is a lot of information available on the web explaining how it is done correctly, such as, e.g., <a href=""http://www.coffeeresearch.org/espresso/tamping.htm"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tamping is an important part of making a good espresso shot, so yes, you should press the coffee in the portafilter.</strong></p>

<p>The reason for compressing the coffee powder is to allow the pump to build up the pressure needed for brewing espresso correctly. If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents <strong>channelling</strong>, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder.</p>

<p>If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tamp with less force. The correct pressure depends on the coffee powder, the diameter of the portafilter, etc. - so 22.5 kgs may simply not be right for your combination of machine and powder.</li>
<li>Grind your coffee less fine - this will lower the resistance.</li>
<li>Change your beans. In my experience, lighter roasts cause more resistance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Options two and three are only listed for the sake of completeness - normally the tamper force is adapted to the other variables, and not the other way around. A good espresso making tutorial should give you a starting point on how to find the correct tamping force and grind coarseness level for your combination of beans and machine. Also, if you own an espresso machine and never heard of tamping, you may want to read one anyway.</p>

<p>From the question, I understand that you want to keep the brewed filtered coffee in the carafe for a while and you are asking for the maximum allowed time for that.</p>

<p>The answer is; the machine will try to keep the coffee intact <strong>as long as it can</strong>; however, at that temperature the water will eventually vaporize and the rest of your coffee will turn into a bitter, dark, burnt coffee.</p>

<p>Simply, your coffee will eventually die as living beings and your high-quality gadget may just slow this, but cannot stop.</p>

<p>Solution: Just taste it. Fresh filtered coffee always tastes better. According to my experience, first half hour is the tasty period.</p>

At the end of the day, just let your customers know that with your knowledge, you can get them what they want if they inform you of a few specific preferences.

<li>Invest. Don't cheap out on grinders or 'spro machines or sourced coffees. Also don't overspend. See how much projected traffic you'd be taking in to see whether a 1, 2, 3, 4 group espresso machine is necessary for 100-200-300 drinks a day. </li>

Darker roasts will have less acidity than a lighter roast (a fairly well established truism).  However, processing method is a huge factor in affecting the flavor of coffee.  Wet and pulp methods are aimed at increasing the ""brightness"" and high notes in coffee, which generally means more acidity.  Dry process tends to enhance the body of coffee at the expense of brightness (less acidity).  It is very hard to directly compare flavor profiles from process methods since they tend to be very distinct by region and it's hard to find coffees that are from the same areas, but processed differently.  Dry process will not work well in a wet/humid region; it will actually produce sub standard coffee.  </p>

<p>If you are willing to change your brew method, as suggested elsewhere, cold brew may also be a way to go.</p>

<p>But while investigating and analyzing data, discovered interesting facts, to my mind, which are against of approach of keeping coffee in thermoses:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Caffeine is getting out</strong> quicker, than I was thinking. A cup of brewed coffee left at room temperature for <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/r7ycf/does_dayold_coffee_lose_its_caffeine_content/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">24 hours had about 60% of its caffeine remaining</a>. Coffee left at 4 degrees Celsius for 2 weeks had less than 5% of its original caffeine content.</li>
<li>It's <strong>hard to wash</strong> these kind of thermoses from inside, normally you just rinse them intensively. So initial bacteria concentrations are higher than in dish-washed containers and cups. (this topic on <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1628/how-should-i-clean-a-stainless-coffee-carafe"">cleaning of stainless coffee carafe</a> could be considered)</li>
<li><strong>The coffee which gets into thermos containers isn't that boiling hot</strong> (80°-85° according to specs) <strong>to make the container ""sterile""</strong>. It would likely be safe for many bacteria that found coffee a nice growth medium. As the counter argument, for a sterile container, not related to thermoses storage: <a href=""https://cooking.stackexchange.com/a/66005"">coffee can be stored for and consumed within 8 weeks</a> (the general bacterial count was &lt;1 CFU/mL).</li>
<li>The thermos doesn't have heating source, and <strong>loses it's temperature pretty quick</strong> 1.5-3 hours, is my guess. It reaches ideal temperature (approximately 34-37 degrees) and boosts the processes being perfect medium, which encourages the growth of bacteria/fungi (<em>see #2 and #3 above</em>).</li>
<li>Coffee <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/123/when-does-coffee-go-off"">degradation over time</a> and <strong>the loss of aromatics affects the flavor profile</strong>.</li>

2721,2,,2016-04-15T20:00:10.017,4,,"<p>It's the same answer to the question, Why does hot water clean better?</p>

<p>When water is hot, the molecules spread farther apart and move around faster. This allows the molecules to work its way in to dirty material and loosen it up. It speeds up the process of soluble matter in becoming solubilized.</p>

<p>So does hot water clean better? Well it cleans faster, which to many people is indeed better.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean cold water can't clean, and in the same way, it doesn't mean cold water can't solubilize the flavors in coffee. But it is slower.</p>

<p>Another part of this is that the flavor of anything is different cold vs hot. Some people prefer hot to cold coffee and so out of convenience just hot brew instead of going through the trouble to brew it cold and then heat it up.</p>

<p>I'd also argue that cold brewing vs hot brewing extract different proportions of acids/tannins/flavors, and that you can brew with varying times/temperatures/pressure to get the proportions you prefer. You may like the proportions that hot brewed coffee gives, but want to drink it cold (such as iced-coffee). Or the reverse, cold-brewed served hot.</p>

2722,2,,2016-04-16T01:44:49.527,6,,"<p>I think there are a number of factors influencing the current situation.</p>

<ul>
<li>The rise of micro/small and home roasters.  This allows people access to fresher coffee.  The acidic and bright notes in coffees tend to fade quicker than roast notes.  Meaning these bright notes are more readily available to the consumer.</li>
<li>Changes in coffee processing.  Different process methods favor different flavor profiles.  Dry Process (the oldest) favors less bright and more bodied flavors.  Newer processing methods enhance bright flavor profiles.</li>
<li>The rise and market dominance of large chain roasters.  These companies tend to roast dark because it is easier to hit a consistent flavor profile which lasts longer (important for shipping), but it sacrifices the origin flavors which are varied greatly and available.  They have given dark roasts a more McDonald's character among consumers (consistent, but not high quality). </li>
</ul>

<p>This is not to say that dark roasts are bad.  But they have partially been given a bad rep by large chains who are using them to maximize profit, and not flavor.  Home and microroasters now also have unprecedented access to a HUGE variety of beans that years back would have been out of reach.  This means that companies can cheaply distribute very high quality beans with extraordinary flavor profiles when roasted at a lighter level.  </p>

2737,2,,2016-04-20T01:44:33.167,7,,"<p>Short answer: <strong><em>Slowly. Binary search.</em></strong> But for espresso, Turkish, moka, or AeroPress: I adjust mine to nearly the tightest (smallest) setting possible that still allows me to turn the crank without difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Method:</strong> This is how I adjust mine.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Approximate the setting by eye.</strong> Looking at the burrs, gauge about how large you'd like your grounds to be. </li>
<li><strong>Mark this setting</strong> (temporarily) with a wax pen or marker.</li>
<li><strong>Grind a bit of coffee</strong> and look at the average grind size; <strong>determine whether you'd like it coarser or finer.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Change the setting</strong> by N (e.g., 4) steps in one direction.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat</strong>. Grind a bit more coffee. If you went in the correct direction (finer or coarser), determine whether you'd like it finer or coarser. (Start over if you went in the wrong direction)</li>
<li>Change the setting by going N ÷ 2 (e.g., 2) steps in that direction.</li>
<li>Repeat the grind and check. Terminate if you're happy, or go one step at a time until you are happy.</li>
<li><strong><em>MARK THIS SETTING</strong> AND HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHANGE IT</em> ;-)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My experience:</strong> I have a similar Hario model (<a href=""http://www.hario.co.uk/coffee/hand-grinder/ceramic-grinder-skerton.html"">this one</a>), which sounds marginally <em>more</em> difficult to adjust than the one you're talking about. I use mine for almost all of my daily coffee grinding. I set it very infrequently: I go through phases between pour-over and moka, and I try not to go through these phases more than once per month to avoid adjusting this thing.</p>

<p>To adjust my model:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove top nut.</li>
<li>Remove crank handle.</li>
<li>Remove setting bracket.</li>
<li>Twist the toothed, threaded washer/nut about the threaded shaft to move the nut up (counter-clock, coarser grind) or down (clock-wise, finer grind).</li>
<li>Replace bracket, handle, top nut.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mark the ""set-screw"" nut with a marker to remember where I've tried. I try to avoid going more than one revolution either way; on mine, two revolutions goes from moka-fine powder to French-press coarseness.</p>

<p><strong>When you've figured it out...</strong> I have put scratch ""marks"" on the screw for I (moka: fine), II (drip: medium), III (French press: coarse) so that I don't have to guess quite as much. Highly recommend indelible marks on your grinder once you find the setting you like. To change from one setting to the other, adjust to the middle: then go tighter to the ""fine"" setting, and looser to the ""coarse"" setting (otherwise, it can be ambiguous).</p>

<p>Other than changing the settings, I like the thing. There was even a Kickstarter that funded a stabilizing mechanism for the bottom to ensure a more-even grind: it launched as <a href=""http://kuissential.com/product/evengrind-coffee-grinder/"">EvenGrind</a> (I have no affiliation with it).</p>

2739,2,,2016-04-21T01:42:46.780,2,,"<p>A well sourced coffee that has been properly roasted and brewed can be amazingly sweet. It's not the same kind of sweetness of cane sugar, but maybe milk is a better example. Milk is not entirely sweet when cold, but as soon as you heat it to around 130F, it's turns deliciously sweet. 
In any event, you will want a lighter roasted coffee. I think it can be a strange transition for people's pallets, especially for people that have been drinking a darker roasted coffee their whole lives, it becomes hard to identify a light coffee with the ""coffee taste."" A lighter roasted coffee preserves the sugars within the coffee, and brings out the wonderful acids and flavors that come from the fact that coffee is indeed the seed of a fruit. 
I think if I was you, I would purchase some coffee from a specialty coffee roaster (like: verve, ritual, 49 parallel, Intelligencia) and see if one of them really amazes you in any way, and then try and achieve that same roast profile. Other then that, don't always take those taste profiles to heart! They can certainly be different for anyone, and some often pretty silly. </p>

<p>I prefer air poppers. They're simple and cheap. I have a modified Air Crazy I've used for 3-4 years and a more recently acquired unmodified Poppery 2.  The Poppery 2 is easier and roasts larger batches but I haven't really dialed in the method as well as the Air Crazy. The Poppery 2 shows great potential and I'd recommend an old one bought on ebay for any beginner. $20 or so and it roasts 2-3 days worth for my 3 person household per batch. </p>

<p>Commercially produced home roasters can run $200-500. You gain automation and maybe consistency for that price though. I've been so happy with the air poppers I've never bought a machine.</p>

<p>---Side note about air roasting (in poppers at least)- it definitely doesn't produce a homogenous roast for me when using blends. I've spent a lot of time watching the beans while roasting and I attribute this to varying size, density and moisture in the varietals used in the mix. Even single source coffees may vary in these characteristics to a lesser degree.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that typically those cupping notes are often written down as they carry out (hopefully) systematic cupping sessions. I wouldn't expect those distinct note descriptions to match up entirely unless you were going through the same cupping technique. Various brew methods will accentuate (dare I say alter) different qualities of coffee, and I think the coffee cupping method is the most efficient way to present varying coffee's eccentricities. A filtered coffee may ""rob"" you of the body they talk about, and a percolator will rob you of, well, everything (I jest).</p>

<p>Someone who spends a lot of time cupping and then employing different brew methods is best positioned to say how a berry-like coffee might taste like as an espresso vs as a black chemex.

The sealant used will clog the pores of the filter paper and you will never get enough coffee in the filter to make it taste decent while making it affordable.

<blockquote>
<p>When coffee is brewed in a french press, the main parameters are (apart from the coffee itself)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the temperature of the water</p>
</li>
<li><p>the duration of brewing</p>
</li>
<li><p>the water quality</p>

</blockquote>
<p>However, I would argue an important parameter is missing from the above list that directly affects the speed at which the plunger presses down. I'm talking about the <strong>grind size</strong>.</p>
<p>Just as a puck of espresso must be ground and tamped to ensure even extraction, the same applies to the grounds used in the French Press method.</p>
<p>For instance, this <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/french-press"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">guide</a> from Blue Bottle recommends
the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it’s hard to press, that means your grind is too fine; if the plunger thunks immediately down to the pot’s floor, it means your grind is too coarse. The sweet spot, pressure-wise, is <strong>15-20 pounds</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the above &quot;sweet spot&quot; may be subjective (i.e., author's bias, type of beans used, grind level, equipment/Brand, etc.), you can use the above as a benchmark to ensure your grounds are not <em>too</em> fine or <em>too</em> coarse. If one or the other, you're liable to over-extract or under-extract when brewing your coffee, impairing the quality of the beans to truly shine.</p>

2751,2,,2016-04-26T11:17:31.223,5,,"<p>As has been mentioned, the species of coffee makes a difference. There are something like a hundred different species, with Robusta and Arabica being the most common commercially grown by far.  Liberica is another species that is grown in small quantities and has a very distinctive taste.</p>

<p>Within a single species such as Arabica, there can be a huge number of varietals. Some are naturally occuring (such as Bourbon and Typica). Maragogype (""elephant bean"") is also a naturally occuring mutation from Brazil. Others have been bred by research institutes. For example SL-28 and SL-34 are common Kenyan varietals. </p>

<p>Another famous varietal is the ""Gesha"" (sometimes romantically but incorrectly called ""Geisha""). This came to light when an estate in Pananma ""La Esmarelda"" noted something interesting when they were cupping their coffee. By separating their harvest, they finally identified a small section which was contributing to the overall cup. This coffee went on to dominate the Cup of Excellence competition and set a world record price at the time. It's since been planted on other farms which brings up the next point.....</p>

<p>As has been mentioned, things like altitude, soil and micro-climate affect the taste. So the Gesha (or any other) varietal from one farm won't taste exactly the same as Gesha from another farm. </p>

<p>The way of preparing the green beans - washed, dry-processed, or a number of other methods, all have their effect on the final flavour. So even the identical cultivar harvested from the same farm but prepared differently will produce different flavours. (The difference between dry and wet-processed is very signficant.) The actual care taken during preparation is also hugely important - I suspect that if one is starting out with a decent high grown bean, this is what really separates speciality coffee from the mass produced stuff. It takes a lot more care to prep the coffee carefully.</p>

<p>And I haven't even mentioned roasting and brewing....</p>

<p>I think this is what makes coffee so interesting - there <em>is</em> so much variety to try and enjoy.</p>

<li>Growing Conditions:  Plants with the same genetics, but grown in vastly different climates will have differences in flavor.  Humidity, rainfall, elevation and temperature all have their say with a set of plants.  Coffee is ultimately an agricultural product and will vary accordingly.</li>
<li>Processing:  There are a variety of processing methods.  Dry Process, Pulp Natural and Wet Processing will all produce different flavor results with the same beans.  Different methods are more accessible or more/less useful varying by region.</li>
<li>Roast Method:  Flavor profiles may also vary by roast method.  Air roasting and contact roasting may highlight different notes in coffee.</li>
<li>Roast Level:  The level to which beans are roasted (along with how that level is reached) is the last factor to affect the bean.  </li>

2755,2,,2016-04-26T16:30:43.760,7,,"<p>Off the top of my head (by no means exhaustive):</p>
<h3>A two-group double boiler espresso machine</h3>
<p>You want two groups in case something goes wrong with one of them, you're not out of business. You also want to be able to use the steam wands while extracting, so the need for each group to have a double boiler is pretty big.</p>
<p>Instead of one machine that costs a ton, you can get two machines (each with one group and a double boiler) that cost anywhere from $1000 to $3500 instead. Try not to go with home appliances - even though I have nothing but great things to say about Breville, they <em>aren't</em> designed for that kind of continuous duty cycle.</p>
<p>Redundancy is not all that's important, you need to be able to make more than one drink at a time :)</p>
<h3>At least two burr grinders with dose control</h3>
<p>Dose control gives you consistency. And you need to be able to grind as many beans as you plan to offer without cleaning grinders each time. These can get insanely expensive as you get into features like auto tamping - the biggest thing to look for is accurate dose control.</p>
<p>I recommend a model that fires once you stick a portafilter under it, with a button to extract into a pitcher. They <em>sometimes</em> come with a small stand to tamp, if not, grab some of them (if not auto-tamping).</p>
<h3>Refrigeration</h3>
<p>I don't recommend using a cooler with ice for dairy - it's going to start off as too cold and work its way up to being too warm. A small dorm-size fridge would be better, and cheap enough that you can have a backup you can run home to get if you need it. Get a good fridge thermometer to figure out the ideal setting for the fridge (usually a dial between 0 and 9), mark it with a sharpie once you get around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (don't buy one that won't go below 40 degrees). Remember that fridges have cold spots, so measure at the bottom as well as near the coils (where the ice lives).</p>
<p>You also need refrigeration for you, too. Nothing says gross like sweat falling into coffee! An evaporative air cooler, or at least some fans really help.</p>
<h3>Misc Equipment</h3>
<p>Your pour-over setup, some presses, tables, rubber mats, pitchers, various kinds of spoons, condiment / syrup dispensers, napkins, etc. Don't forget cups, sleeves, alternative sweeteners (be nice, buy honey from a vendor there, helps business). Also, don't forget corrugated trays (recycled) for large orders.</p>
<p>You can also never have enough cotton bar mop rags. Don't forget a camping stove or induction cooker, and if you use an induction cooker, make sure everything you need to put on it will work.</p>
<p>If you're going to be blending stuff, get a <em>good</em> blender that can eat through ice easily. Another thing that's nice to have two of in case one breaks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Don't forget, you need to be able to wash your hands.</strong></em> Sanitizer is good, but having a basin and bucket is also helpful.</p>
<p>And, don't forget whack-buckets, trash cans, etc.</p>
<h3>Ticket Handling System</h3>
<p>This is really important. Imagine you have 20 people lined up and 10 orders going. Make sure you know what people ordered, what needs to go out next, and that the tickets are clear. Soy instead of whole milk? Make sure the person making the drink knows that, and that it goes to the right person.</p>
<p>POS (point of sale) systems are increasingly cheap and really help with this. But old fashioned pen and paper tickets work well too, if you have a system in place. This is a really bad way a great setup can fail if you don't get it right.</p>
<h3>Water</h3>
<p>You're going to need some big plastic bladders full of clean filtered water. You'll also need to make sure it's possible to get that water into the coffee machines easily :) Transporting that much water can be a challenge because it can get so heavy that applying the breaks in a normal vehicle takes on a whole new dynamic. Got a place that delivers it?</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Make sure you do a dry run, that's the only way you'll be sure you have everything you need.</p>
<p>Everything else is pretty unique to what you want to offer, but if you keep it simple it's not <em>too</em> bad. If you're going to offer cakes and snacks, have a way to keep them fresh.</p>
<h3>Menu Items</h3>
<p>Keep it simple and keep it confined to what <em>you</em> can make consistently well. Tell people they're welcome to ask, but avoid anything super complicated from becoming a permanent fixture on the menu.</p>
<h3>Cost your drinks</h3>
<p>You should charge 3x your cost to be safe, 2 - 2.5x if you want or need to be <em>really</em> competitive. 3x is pretty certain to cover your costs, overhead, and profit. You need to know how much it costs you to make every single thing, how much it costs to just open and tear down, and everything else. Another great reason for keeping a simple (10 things is good) menu.</p>

<hr>

<p>I think, one should know the diversity of these three <em>main</em> techniques to distinguish the differences. There will be other minor techniques, as well.</p>

<p>All these techniques are in essence used to protect the bean from bacteria, mold and fungi right after the harvest. The coffee fruit is full of sugar and fermentation starts rapidly after the fruit leaves the tree. Thus, peeling of the fruit from the bean rapidly may help to get rid of the mold risk. If you choose to get the fruity tastes affect your bean and leave the fruit around your bean, then you should take proper care about mold and fungi. This may be especially difficult in big plantations as you need around 20 days and huge flat areas.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Wet process</strong> can be said the industry standard. The fruit is <em>totally peeled off to the bean</em>, then the beans are dried.</p>

<p>1.a. <strong>Double-washed process</strong> is a process that the fruits are first washed to the bean. After the fermentation starts, it is washed for a second (or several) times. This technique is also known as <em>Kenyan process</em>. The result is a very clean flavor.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>dry process</strong>, the fruits are left intact to dry themselves. During this process, they should be moved regularly to protect them from mold and fungus. When the humidity is around 13%, they are peeled of, washed and dried for the second round.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Semi-dry/semi-washed/pulped-natural/honey</strong>, <em>just the skin of the fruit</em> is peeled of, but the meaty part is left on the bean. Then, the fruit is dried, peeled of to the bean, washed and dried for the second round.</p>

<p>3.a. In <strong>50% washed</strong> processing method is the method where the processing is akin to honey method, but the meaty part of the fruit is peeled of halfway to the bean. This peeling of may be done in the beginning or sometime during the fermentation. As mentioned, the aim is balancing the sugar level and protecting the beans from mold, etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>It is clear that <strong>pulp-natural</strong> or <strong>dry</strong> processing are costlier than <strong>wet</strong> processing -whatever the metric is; monetary, labor or time.</p>

<p>Another factor is flavor. <strong>Dry</strong> or <strong>pulp-natural</strong> processed beans include more fruity notes as the fruit fermented together with the bean during the first drying phase.</p>

<p><em>(It is said that pulp-natural beans are less acidic than dry beans, but I have not experience that myself.)</em></p>

<p>Note that, dry or pulp-natural processing is not available everywhere. E.g. if you see a bag of Guatemala dry processed beans*, just run away. As Guatemalan weather is so humid, you can hardly dry process the fruit without mold.</p>

<li>Dry Process | This is the oldest method of modern processing.  It requires very little equipment.  It is basically a manual process of letting the coffee cherries raisin up, then peeling them.  It is a labor intensive process.  Dry processing tends to produce body heavy, smooth coffees with complex notes.  Dry processing is used extensively in Brazil and accounts for the distinct different flavor profiles from other South American coffees.  Dry processing is not practical in humid, wet, or temperate areas, as dry heat is necessary to dry the fruit in a short enough amount of time and to assure that mold or fungus does not set in.</li>
<li>Wet Process | This method start with running the cherries through machinery to remove the skin and outer layers of the fruit.  The beans with remaining inner layers of fruit are soaked in water and allowed to ferment.  Additional processing is done  to remove the final inner layers surrounding the bean.  The result is left to dry (usually with additional machine assistance).  Wet processing requires a comparatively large investment in equipment, access to enough water for the process and creates waste water that must also be dealt with.  The process does allow for multiple areas to sort beans (floating during fermentation, in channel after fruit strip, etc) that potentially allow for a more uniform product.  Wet processed coffees tend to be missing the overt fruit notes of a dry process, but this is debatable and can vary based on fermentation methods (additional additives are sometimes used in the fermenting process).  </li>
<li>Semi-Dry / Pulped Natural / Wet Hulled / Semi-Washed | This process is similar to the wet process except the fermentation step is skipped and specialized machines are used to strip the final layers from around the bean.  This method can produce beans with the best of both processing methods, but the machines used to strip the inner layers away are also prone to damaging beans.  This is a faster method of processing but again requires machine investment and resource use.  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are many other factors influencing coffee processing that should be kept in mind.  Individual farmers may not have a choice of processing method.  In many places the processing centers for coffee are quite separate from farms and only one processing center may be available.  Local conditions will also largely dictate what methods are appropriate or available.  There are also a myriad of variations on these methods that may produce different results and weather can play a factor as well (think about an area hit by a monsoon while large batches are trying to dry).  At some level, all farmers are trying to get paid for what they produce.  That being the case, most will prefer some combination of whatever local processing method is available and/or cheapest and produces the highest pricing for their product.  </p>

<p>The espresso purest would tell you that there are coffee oils that are left on all surfaces of the brew path after the water flows through the grounds and these oils quickly become rancid.  I'm not really sure how much oil is left on the portafilter after a shot is prepared, but needless to say, this oil will be present, and in order for it to not affect the flavor of any subsequent shots, needs to be cleaned.</p>

<p>If you cannot detect a flavor difference in the second shot and like the way it tastes, don't worry about it and enjoy your doppio.  Otherwise do some experimenting to really see if cleaning it gives you a better result that you desire.</p>

If you have already inserted the basket in the portafilter then dose and tamp, the only required action after tamping is inserting it into the machine's group head.  If on the other hand, you dose and tamp into the basket first, then you have to next insert the basket into the portafilter which has the chance to deform the puck (you do have to exert a bit of pressure to insert the basket into the portafilter!).  This just becomes yet another variable you must control for to gain repeat-ability in your preparation process, and great espresso is all about process.</p>

2760,2,,2016-04-27T21:31:21.150,3,,"<p>This is an intriguing question which I wanted to ask myself. From what I could gather, there are two points here, one theoretical and one empiric.</p>

<p>As far as I know, caffeine is one of the fastest-extracting compounds in coffee, such that it is extracted almost immediately, so, logically, the amount of caffeine in a brew would only be determined by the amount of beans that go into it and not the brewing method. Which means that whatever comes out of the AeroPress could not possibly have that much more caffeine than other methods. Particularly, not significantly more than an espresso shot, since the amounts of coffee used are about the same.</p>

<p>My own experience, however, suggests otherwise.
When I first got my AeroPress, I (naturally) brewed some coffee with it. Upon drinking just half of the brew, I got a kick stronger than after anything I'd ever consumed before. Several days later I hosted a party where I served AeroPress coffee, and about two thirds of the guests independently noted that the coffee was unusually strong. </p>

<p>Solving this contradiction seems pretty hard. Right now I see several (not entirely exclusive) possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>first, that AeroPress brew really does have a significantly higher caffeine content. 
<em>Pretty unlikely, but the possibility is nonzero.</em></li>
<li><p>second, that AeroPress brew contains high concentrations of some non-caffeine compounds, which:</p>

<ul>
<li>are produced  in significantly lower quantities with other brewing methods, and </li>
<li>strongly contribute to the typical effects of consuming lots of coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I don't know how likely this is, since I'm not aware of whether caffeine is the only major contributor to the effects of coffee.</em></p></li>
<li><p>finally, that it is mainly a placebo-like psychological effect.
<em>Also unlikely, since the guests at the party probably did not have any prior preconceptions about AeroPress coffee.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bottom line: coffee from the AeroPress does tend to be perceived as stronger than average by a variety of people (including stronger after-coffee effects), but caffeine might not be the reason.</strong></p>

Almost all of the substitutes I have heard are fat sources designed to get fat based calories into the coffee.  The vanilla bean powder you have heard about adds almost no calories, but will certainly add flavor.  It accomplishes a very different goal than what the Bulletproof folks are espousing.</p>

<p>Keep in mind there are any number of things you can add to coffee to make the caffeine more palatable.  There is an entire industry surrounding this.  What you really need to ask is what you are trying to accomplish by adding something and find the best ingredient for your needs.  Low or no calories flavoring agents maybe suited if you are just not into the taste of coffee.  If you are looking for a fat calorie source, experimenting with different oils until you find one that fits your needs and has a flavor you can deal with may be the way to go.  </p>

<p>Personally I look for more protein and not as much fat in my diet.  I like the taste of coffee.  A plain cup of cone coffee and a serving of organic Greek yogurt accomplishes what I am trying to do just fine and doesn't require breaking out or cleaning a blender.  </p>

If you're looking at spending a $1000 total and go with something that requires a little more technique, maybe the popular Rancilio Silvia / Rocky combination is right for you. Also, some say that the grinder is actually the most important component to consider when trying to make amazing coffee on a budget. It might be worth shorting yourself a bit on the machine to afford yourself a better grinder in the long run. I'd recommend the Baratza Vario as a starting point. It's pricier, but it does a fantastic job for both drip and espresso. Also, Baratza has amazing support/service and a history of quality. That can be worth quite a bit in the long run.</p>

Honestly. Try some freshly roasted coffee and you'll know the difference. Having said that, let's move on.</p>

<p>What you've described in the question is talking mainly about extraction.
Coffee gets extracted as below.</p>

<p>Sour > Flavour > Bitter</p>

<p>If it's sour, it's underextracted. If it's bitter, it's over extracted. Now this does not mean there will not be any sour or bitter notes in the coffee. There will be but it needs to be balanced.
The roasting of the coffee plays an important role too. Some coffees are roasted for far too long and they come out tasting bitter. This is usually the case when the roaster is either inexperienced or is trying to cover up poor quality beans.</p>

<p>To adjust extraction, you can adjust temperature, grind size and brewing method. Some like drip causes the water to flow over the the grounds at rate that's proportional to the flow of water into the drip brewer (like Hario V60) and the size of grinds. Some others, like Aeropress, lets the grinds steep in the water with a little bit of agitation. You need to pick one method that you're comfortable with, then adjust the parameters for that brew method.</p>

<p>You can try increasing and reducing water temperature too.
So how will you know you got a good cup? Taste it. When you start to taste flavours that you've never encountered with that coffee before, you know you're heading in the right direction.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. Enjoy brewing and enjoy sipping the cuppa.</p>

<p>The supplied link in @William Moore's answer requires sugar. The continuous misunderstanding about sugar usage with Turkish brewing in North America is so surprising to me. In Turkey, regular Turkish coffee drinkers hardly –if not never‒ drink their coffee with sugar. However, sugar is optional in recipes.</p>

<p>In @William Moore's own recipe, in 2nd article, pre-heating does not add any visible advantage, only shortens the time to brew. This is actually what is needed to keep the foam intact and prevent the vaporization of the lipids in Turkish brewing. However, you can provide it by using stronger fire easily in contrast to William Moore's 4th article. It is better to use the time span as the size of your cezve may change, you may brew just for yourself or for five people.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was trying to make a coffee in her lab, she used the microwave to heat the water (I hope you enthusiast do not crucify us for this bewildering savagery). She set the timer to 2.5 min, but then had to run some work. After returning the water had already cooled beyond usability, thus she restarted the heating process for approx. 30s. Before reheating she realized that there was a lot of steam in the microwave cavity. 
After the reheating she takes out the cup, and after having taken it out, the water in the cup <strong>explodes</strong> in her face. </p>

<p>Some word on the used hardware:</p>

<p>The microwave is an old model from Carrefour home
The cup is an ordinary ceramic cup with shape of a truncated cone. </p>

<p>This is not a joke, she did really burn herself and was lucky that she chose her glasses instead of her contacts. However more interesting is, how this explosion came about. There must have been some pressure build up inside the cup but how would such an inhomogeneity in such a small volume be explainable?</p>

2800,2,,2016-05-12T12:12:09.713,3,,"<p>I think this discussion should start with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maillard reaction</a>; known as caramelization.</p>

<p>When the beans are roasted, a chemical reaction activated by heat reduce sugars (more correctly, hydrocarbons) within the beans with the proteins (more correctly, amino acids). During this time, some carbon dioxide is emitted as a result of this process and jailed within the cell structure. During this reaction, many organic molecules within the bean are pyrolysed (chemically separated by fire). Probably at that phase, many aromatic lipids emerge that we are actually tasting and trying to extract during brewing. Note that, more fruity aromas were already in the bean before pyrolysis (or caramelization, Maillard reaction, roasting... You may use interchangeably).</p>

<p>Now, let's reason about under- and over- roasted beans:</p>

<p>If you have <strong>under-roasted beans</strong>, you have less carbon dioxide. So you have less foam. You have less aromatic lipids, so you have less aroma. But the overall aroma is more fruity.</p>

<p>If you have <strong>over-roasted beans</strong>, you have so much carbon dioxide. So the cup will sure have a foam. You have aromatic lipids, but probably you have burnt some of the fragile organic molecules on the road. Thus you have a lot of aroma, but the overall aroma will be a bit burnt and bitter.</p>

<p><em><strong>Edit:</strong> I realized that @Geo already explained the Maillard reaction very neatly in a previous answer <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2172/quantifying-flavor-differences-between-varieties/2550#2550"">here</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>A short explanation may be helpful for the community, so I decided to take a note here.</em></p>

<p>The reason behind that is the super-heated water. In theory, it is possible to super-heat any liquid with polar molecules.</p>

<p>Temperature of an object is defined by the total kinetic energy of its molecules. The kinetic energy has two sources, the linear velocity of molecules, and spin of molecules.</p>

<p>Microwave ovens heat up objects by adding <em>spin</em> to the molecules of an object. Roughly speaking, molecules stay where they are, but spin around very rapidly under microwave to heat up. <em>During this phase, they cannot find a way to vaporize (linear velocity).</em></p>

<p><strong>When your friend take the cup out of the oven, the molecules are not under the effect of microwave (so they don't spin) anymore, so they find their way out to vaporize, and choose to vaporize (linear velocity) very quickly. That occurs as an explosion.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When water reaches a boiling point, it doesn't necessarily turn to steam. It needs some kind of physical spot—a &quot;nucleation site&quot;—to form a bubble. This can be an imperfection or crevice in the surface of the container. <strong>That’s why a clean, scratch-free jug of water heated in the microwave can seem to be below boiling point, but explode as soon as you move it.</strong></p>
<p>The water in there is super-heated beyond 212 degrees, but hasn’t found any nucleation sites to let it turn into steam. <strong>When you disturb it, swirls in the water can be enough to release all that pent-up energy into steam.</strong> Another example is throwing salt into boiling pasta water. It suddenly roils because you just tossed a handful of nucleation sites in there.</p>

<p>I've occasionally stopped a roast too early and then it's under-roasted to me (and I suspect anybody else) as well! In those cases, the coffee tastes sour and I don't mean acidic, but sour. The sourness is a little like the taste in bread that has got old and soured. It also has a taste that's reminiscent of tea. I like tea but not when when it's meant to be coffee! (If you've ever had Qishr - ""tea"" made from the dried coffee cherry husks - it's pretty close to that, which is not surprising I suppose.)
There are also other coffee tastes which are just absent from under-roasted coffee - there is simply less of that ""coffee"" taste (and it also disappears of the tongue very quickly) and the coffee also has less body.</p>

<p>Thought I would weigh in to provide a little extra help. I'm a barista and head of customer education at Handground. We are working on a French Press brew guide right now but since it's not done, I'll share a quick tutorial.</p>

<p>The goal with brewing coffee on any device is to maximize the extraction of good-tasting flavors and minimize the bitter ones. I suggest starting with the following recipe and then adjusting it to find the right balance of flavor.</p>

<ol>
<li>Heat water to 205F</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on your kettle, this might mean taking your water off the heat for about one minute after boil. Use a thermometer if possible!</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Weigh out coffee to 57g</li>
</ol>

<p>There's an easy ratio to follow when deciding how much coffee to use. It's called the water-to-coffee ratio, and it will help you methodically experiment with different brew recipes. To find the water-to-coffee ratio, take the total mL of water (around 800-850mL for a normal-sized French Press) and then divide by the number of grams of coffee (mL and grams are conveniently equal in weight). In this case, 800/57 is about 14. That means our ratio is 14:1. From now on you can use the inverse of this ratio to adjust your recipe. For example, if you want to try a 15:1 ratio (a weaker coffee), take 800ml and divide by 15 to find the amount of coffee to use. </p>

<p>If you don't have a scale, 57g is roughly a half cup of coffee, but remember that lighter roasts are more dense than dark roasts, so it will require less volume of coffee to reach your desired weight. </p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Grind your coffee course</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's an example of what your grind should look like: 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXWlB.jpg"" alt=""Handground french press grind""></a></p>

<p>It's really important to have a consistent grind. If you don't the different-sized grounds will extract at different rates, meaning some of them will turn bitter and others will stay weak. This is a bad mix of flavors. For the most consistent grind, use a burr <a href=""http://handground.com/handground"" rel=""noreferrer"">coffee grinder</a></p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>Pour water over coffee and let bloom</li>
</ol>

<p>Dump the grounds into the French Press and then pour just enough water over the grounds so they are all saturated. If you have a scale, shoot for about as much water as you have grounds, so 57mL. The coffee will begin to bubble up and ""bloom"" if it is fresh. Let this happen for about 30 seconds</p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li>Pour 800mL water total, set for 4 minutes</li>
</ol>

<p>Pour 800mL of hot water into the French Press to achieve our desired water-to-coffee ratio. For most a normal 32-ounce French Press, this is about an 1 1/2 inches from the top. Start timer for 4 minutes and let the coffee steep. Place the lid on top of the grounds to capture the heat but DO NOT PLUNGE YET!</p>

<ol start=""6"">
<li>Plunge after 4 minutes</li>
</ol>

<p>Press the plunger down through the coffee. This action will tell you something important about your coffee. If pressing the plunger is really difficult, the grind might have been too fine. There should be slight resistance but nothing that makes you struggle. This is one indication that you might need to adjust the grind, but tasting the coffee will be the ultimate test.</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>Remove all coffee from French Press</li>
</ol>

<p>Leaving the coffee (the drink, not the grounds) in the French Press will allow for the coffee to continue extracting, turning it bitter. If you don't drink it all at once, remove it and place in a thermos or carafe. </p>

<p><strong>Adjusting your brew recipe</strong></p>

<p>This recipe is just a starting point. Now you should adjust your recipe to improve the coffee. The best cups of coffee have extracted all the sweet, desirable flavors from the cup and none of the bitter, negative flavors. Naturally then, the best cup of coffee sits right at the tipping point of sweet and bitter. </p>

<p>You should adjust your recipe by changing just one thing at a time. Here's a simple formula to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Assess your latest cup of coffee</li>
</ol>

<p>Was your coffee strong and sweet? Weak and bitter? Somewhere in the middle? Understanding this will be the starting point for adjusting your recipe.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Adjust for coffee strength</li>
</ol>

<p>You adjust the strength of your coffee by changing the amount of coffee you use. We can use the water-to-coffee ratio that we talked about to do this. If your coffee is weak, or watery and tea-like, use a lower water-to-coffee ratio like 13:1 or 12:1. If your coffee is overwhelmingly strong, raise the ratio to 15:1 or 16:1. Divide the amount of water used (800ml) by desired ratio number (14, 15, 16, etc.) to find the number of grams of coffee to use. </p>

<p>Brew another batch of coffee with the adjusted water-to-coffee ratio and repeat until you're happy with the strength.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Adjust for sweetness/extraction</li>
</ol>

<p>Strength and extraction are not the same thing. Strength is the amount of coffee dissolved in the coffee solution while extraction is the percentage of ground coffee that was dissolved. Extraction controls how sweet or bitter a coffee is, but not its strength.</p>

<p>If you notice your coffee is bitter, you should reduce the extraction rate. You can do this in two ways: Make the grind more course or shorten the brew time. Both will allow for less extraction, meaning less negative flavors.</p>

<p>If your coffee is sweet, I suggest finding its peak sweetness before being satisfied. Increase the extraction rate by using a finer grind or extending the brew time. Do this until you brew a batch of coffee that comes out bitter, and then dial your extraction rate back to the last degree where it was sweet. This is as delicious as you will be able to brew your coffee. </p>

<p><strong>Recap</strong></p>

<p>To summarize what I just wrote, here are a few key things to remember about brewing with the French Press and dialing in the optimal recipe:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consistent grind is key</li>
<li>If your coffee is weak, increase the strength by adding more coffee. If it is too strong, use less coffee.</li>
<li>If your coffee is still sweet and not bitter, increase the extraction by using a finer grind or longer brew time. Do this until you find the tipping point between bitter and sweet.</li>
<li>If your coffee is bitter, dial back the extraction. Again, try to find the tipping point. </li>
</ol>

<p>Manipulating the different variables that change your coffee will become second nature the more you do it. Start sharpening your coffee skills by being methodical with the way you experiment. Adjust only one variable at a time so you can see a clear cause and effect. Most importantly, don't let the pursuit of the perfect cup spoil the fun. Any cup of coffee is better than no cup at all, so enjoy the journey. </p>

<p>Kaldi was a herder who discovered his goats would become rambunctious after eating the berries and leaves of a plant. That plant turned out to be the coffee plant.</p>

<p>Upon observing this, Kaldi also partook of the plant's berries, finding it gave him extra energy. Some claim people would crush the berries and mix them with animal fat into rudimentary ""protein bars"".</p>

<p>Eventually they began drying-out the berries and steeping the seeds (beans) in hot water to brew the first coffee to grace the Earth. Thus begins the storied history of coffee consumption!</p>

<hr>

<p>Another anecdote relating to coffee involves Pope Clement VIII. His advisors urged him to ban the consumption of coffee, likening it to the ""Devil's brew"" as it was popular among Muslims.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, after tasting coffee for the first time, the Pope was so impressed he couldn't bare to think of outlawing it. It's said this led to the spread of coffee drinking among Catholics and Italians in general.</p>

<p>This story should be taken with a grain of salt, as whether or not Pope Clement VIII actually said or did what he said, or whether or not his advisors ever broached the topic is a matter of speculation.</p>

<p>That said, there are many more stories surrounding the spread and popularization of coffee. I'll let others add their own stories, as I know there are <strong>many</strong> more out there :)</p>

<p>The wood on the inside might be difficult to clean of coffee oils and impart an odor to your freshly ground coffee.</p>

While mine was an exceptional deal, used Oscars usually go for about $800 on the secondary market. They are built like tanks, easy to use and maintain, and are very repairable with a lot of parts available in case something fails. </p>

2847,2,,2016-05-23T03:53:40.500,3,,"<p>That's correct: as your cup cools, perceived acidity increases. This is due to variation in the chemical species affected by temperature. </p>

<p>Coffee is like ice cream. Ice cream is least sweet when it's stone cold, and tart and heavy when it has melted. Similarly, coffee is sweetest (and best) while it's hot, and is bitter or acrid when it has cooled. Furthermore, the cooler temp has led to chemical degradation and thus the awful taste. However, you won't perceive its flavors when the coffee is too hot -- so let it cool a bit.</p>

<p>As for your question whether the on-contact brew temperature affects end-result sweetness-sourness: there are a lot of baristas and coffee R&amp;D pros who do temperature-control brewing, especially for espresso, in order to modify the flavor of the coffee. </p>

<p>I believe that varying temperature affects coffee flavor in a gradient.</p>

<p>For cold brew (in case you're also curious about that), the cold temperature is a different environment entirely. Coffee is just as soluble, however less energetically kinetic, so more time is substituted for the lack of temperature. The end result is a brew product that functions naturally as a cold product -- nice, sweet, characteristic.</p>

<p>Many different acids are there in your cup: Malic, tannic acid, maleic, oleic, oxalic, caffeic, chlorogenic acids, etc. Also, the carbon dioxide that's produced when the organic molecules are reduced during roasting have an effect on acidity when it's solved in your final cup. All these acidic components are responsible for the overall acidity of the final cup. However, during roasting, generally, the large organic acidic compounds are reduced and overall acidity decreases.</p>

<p><strong>Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki</strong> is a Polish/Ukranian man who is now regarded as a hero and known as the owner of the first coffee house of Vienna. Probably, the inventor of cappuccino.</p>

<p>He was a very fluent speaker in many languages including Ottoman Turkish. During the siege, he is used by the city as a messenger and saved the city in the last day by carrying a critical message by disguising as a janisary (Ottoman soldier) when the city were about the leave the city to the Ottomans.</p>

<p>After the siege, he opens the Europe's third and Vienne's first coffee house with the sacks of coffee beans left by the Ottoman army —which was now retreating and leaving all the heavy stuff behind on the way back home. This was probably one of the first encounters of Europeans to coffee.</p>

<p>Kulczycki's friend Marco d’Aviano who was a Cappuchin monk, thought coffee is quite bitter and choose to add honey and milk into it. When milk added, coffee changed its color from black to brown and looks more like Cappuchin monks traditional robe's color. Kulczycki, named that kind of sweetened coffee after his monk friend.</p>

<p>Right after Kulczycki became known, he even started to wear janisary clothes in his coffeehouse while serving coffee. His monuments are still around Vienna. You can check his Wikipedia page <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Franciszek_Kulczycki"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

2859,2,,2016-05-27T15:01:28.007,7,,"<p>Let's look at this from the worst case:</p>

<p>The <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"">LD50</a> for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine"">caffeine</a></strong> is around 150-200mg/kg body weight for a healthy adult or 10g<sup>1</sup>. The caffeine content of a ""cup of coffee"" (however you define it) varies with beans, roast and preparation method, but according to Wikipedia, (50-)75-100 cups of drip coffee get you in the lethal ballpark. (More caffeine math on this site.) This is an amount of fluid that you can't ingest without other severe complications, but <strong>deaths by pure caffeine</strong>, e.g. in tablets can happen.</p>

<p>If you don't kill yourself, the next serious outcome is <strong>caffeine intoxication</strong>, caused by single doses of about half the LD50 or 400-500mg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.[95] In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.[99][100]<br>
  (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine#Overdose"">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything else is a question of your metabolism and caffeine tolerance vs. desired and undesirable effects. For example: coffee is a stimulant that counters fatigue and drowsiness - and thus can keep you awake if it's not metabolized when you want to sleep.</p>

<p>There is no general ""safety threshold"", but if you look at the recommendation of both the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Congress_of_Obstetricians_and_Gynecologists"">American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)</a> and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Standards_Agency"">UK Food Standards Agency</a> for pregnant women, the 200mg caffeine per day deemed safe for them<sup>2</sup> should be more than safe for every other healthy adult. </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Sources vary between 5-30g, but LD50 rates for humans aren't exactly a field of much experimentation.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Pregnant women show a decreased caffeine metabolism (up to 15 hours vs. 3-4 hours in non-pregnant women) and there is a large safety margin to protect the unborn child.</p>

<hr>

<p>Most of the data reported in the present review may suggest that espresso brewing can be described as “a quick way to transfer carbon dioxide from roasted and ground coffee to a small cup by means of hot water under pressure”. This then leads to the facts that for espresso coffee, carbon dioxide has to be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>generated by roasting</p></li>
<li><p>maintained in the bean by proper packaging</p></li>
<li><p>maintained in the ground coffee</p></li>
<li><p>solubilized in water</p></li>
<li><p>released into the beverage.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In this framework statements such as “any error in grinding or in percolation, in temperature or extraction level, has an immediate effect on denounced by the color, the texture and the persistence of the foam” or “the foam is the signature of a well-prepared espresso” can be well justified. In fact, foam volume, persistence, and consistence are the consequences of the carbon dioxide content originally present in the coffee. In addition to the importance of carbon dioxide in espresso coffee foam, we believe that carbon dioxide can play a role even from a taste point of view.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore; you need to find fresh nice Arabica beans, roast properly, degas for the correct amount of time, grind them well, brew appropriately with decent water right after grinding.</strong></p>

2870,2,,2016-06-02T17:55:41.340,3,,"<p>There are <em>many</em> ways to brew coffee, and several that are on the ""inexpensive"" end of the spectrum. Your tone sounds like you're not <em>very</em> into coffee, so to that end here are my broad recommendations in that will give you an adequate cup with minimal fuss and expense.</p>

<p><strong>You'll need two basic pieces of equipment:</strong></p>

<p><strong>A grinder</strong>. You can buy an inexpensive electric rotary grinder that will be adequate for most purposes -- one example <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00006IUX5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from Amazon</a>. You can also use it for grinding spices or seeds. If you already have one, you will get <em>some</em> odor holdover from one grinding mission to the next, but it's probably fine if you're not very picky. 10-15 quid new, or even cheaper used from a thrift shop etc. You can even mash them up with mortar and pestle.</p>

<p><strong>Some brewing mechanism</strong>. The cheapest and simplest are probably <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">drip brew</a> (e.g., pour-over or auto-drip), but I online a few more down below. Your options are manual pour-over (my recommendation) or auto-drip:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Manual pour-over</strong>. My pick would be a manual pour-over coffee cone, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0014CVEH6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">such as this one</a>, a plastic cone holder for like 5 quid. You put the cone over a mug, put in a paper filter, add medium-grind coffee (even as fine as the rotary grinder will give you will be okay), and slowly pour water over the top until brewed.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-drip</strong>. You can find a really cheap auto-drip machine, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001NXC5YC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">for instance this one from Amazon</a>, for like 10-15 quid, or even cheaper used. Water goes in the reservoir, paper filter in the basket, add some ground coffee, press the button.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's one solution for decent cup of coffee for as little as 15 quid all in (grinder, coffee cone, paper filters), or perhaps 25-30 for an auto-drip solution.</p>

<p>On the other hand if you want coffee with the oil left in(the paper filter removes the oil) a french press or percolator will be your cheapest option, or if you want to be able to do fancy ""coffee shop"" drinks (eg latte's, americano's, etc) then you have to bite the bullet and pay for an espresso machine, which tend to run a little more, and again you have to pay attention to the temperature that the machine runs at.  </p>

At the same time, excess exposure to oxygen will cause coffee to go stale quickly.  Commercial roasters have packaging machinery that sucks the air out of the bag and puts coffee beans under vacuum for storage.  The packages usually have a small vent hole to release carbon dioxide without allowing outside air into the bag.</p>

2882,2,,2016-06-13T20:00:01.400,7,,"<p>Yes, there is a way to store freshly roasted coffee - or even store bought roasted beans - at home under vacuum without expensive equipment.  I drink wine and have collected a couple of wine storage devices over the years that I no longer use.  One of these is a bottle stopper with a one-way valve in the top and a vacuum pump for removing the air from a partially consumed bottle of wine.  </p>

<p>My idea was to clean out the bottle and fill it with freshly roasted coffee beans, then use the vacuum pump and stopper to apply suction to the bottle to encourage the carbon dioxide to exit the beans without worrying about oxygen making the beans go stale prematurely.</p>

<p>I've found that the beans emit enough carbon dioxide gas to require re-pumping the bottle for the first day or two, but after that it will hold a vacuum indefinitely.  I've added erasable labels to the bottle to record the type of roasted beans I have inside.  Two standard wine bottles will hold about 610 grams of roasted beans, or about 700 grams of unroasted beans, which is 7 batches in my SR 500 roaster.  These are Ethiopian, YMMV.</p>

<p>Coffee is considered organic if no chemical substances were used for its production. This includes herbicides, pesticides, and I believe some fertilizers too. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> agrees with this.</p>

<p>But even if you're a coffee producer and you're sure you don't use chemical substances and there are no residues in the soil, that's not enough. You have to <strong>certify</strong> your product and you'll be able to say that your coffee is <em>certified organic</em>. The certification process and agency will depend on where the coffee is grown.</p>

<p>Of course, the certification costs. And some producers might not afford it (thanks to <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/76/chris-in-ak"">Chris_in_AK</a> for pointing this out).</p>

<p>Since you're only roasting the beans and not producing them, it's not really up to you (you could ask your provider if the beans they're selling you are certified organic). But you could buy beans that are certified organic.</p>

<p>Note that 0.0% fat milk is not available everywhere. For example, it is common in central Europe that the lowest percentage of fat available for milk is 0.3% or 1.5%. I recently checked at a German Starbucks what milk they have to pour into filter coffee, and they start at 1.5% fat. Note that even if the label on a box of milk says 0% fat, there will always be some traces of fat. </p>

<p>Whether it tastes well: that is subjective. Fat <em>does</em> add to the taste. But a 0.3% fat milk Cafe Latte is probably closer to a 1.5% fat milk Cafe Latte in terms of taste than to a coconut milk Cafe Latte, which is also enjoyed by many coffee consumers and also bears the name ""Cafe Latte"". Whether you will actually be able to get a close-to-0% fat Cafe Latte depends on the place that you are visiting: not all coffee places may have that type of milk in stock.</p>

I did a couple of experiments to check whether this is working, namely mass-spectrometry on the brewed coffee. Although this does not directly link to the taste, it confirms my theory that the nitrogen atmosphere conserves the solubles in the coffee for a longer period of time.
In a good atmosphere (>0.1ppm H20 and >0.1ppm O2) and no ambient light, the flavor, in my opinion, can be conserved for up to six months.</p>

An example can be still be seen with the Italian practice of seasoning a moka pot.  When a metal coffee container (moka pot or coffee cup) is new/washed, the coffee takes on a metallic flavor.  Once the container has been used once or twice, the oils from the coffee seal the internal surface preventing the metallic flavor from tainting the brew.  (Many Italians believe that a new moka pot is not usable until several pots of coffee have been brewed and dumped out first)</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine the evolution from practical process to tradition by thinking of the time of transition from metal to ceramic coffee mugs.

They have led us to believe that it has to do with the off-gassing. It absolutely does not. There are lipids and other such oils and fatty compounds in the coffee. These are what go stale. These can be preserved by freezing the coffee in air tight containers. Technical specifics can be found in Michael Sivetz's book ""Coffee Technology"". Freezing/unfreezing/re-freezing isn't a good technique. If you can manage - break up your supply into the amounts you'd normally use and store them like that individually...in the freezer. Small glass jars that seal air tight work perfect.</p>

<p>Coffee brewers, including myself, tend to use weight as our measuring unit as opposed to volume since bean sizes vary significantly already without accounting for origin or roast level. All of these factors will change the real amount of coffee you believe you have once ground and also change the extraction parameters needed to make a cup of coffee of the 'same strength'.</p>

<p>From what it sounds, I doubt that the beans you use are of the same variety as the pre-ground coffee you used to use. Not all coffee will taste the same nor brew the same, and the best way to track and refine your brewing to your taste is to measure accurately your bean (origin/blend, roast level, weight used, grind size), water (to coffee ratio, temperature, purity), and extraction time. Depending on what brewing method you use there may be more parameters you will have to account for but ultimately the aforementioned factors will always play a role in any form of coffee brewing.</p>

<p>Start by weighing an amount of pre-ground coffee that you used previously to find out how much coffee you used exactly and start by grinding that much of your new beans to brew.</p>

<p>The Rafino seems to be tailored more towards the filter or french press brewer. In these brewing methods, fines, the smaller coffee particles produce the majority of the problem in extraction and off-flavours produced in the end cup. With filter brewing, it restricts water flow and can cause inconsistencies in the extraction. With french press, the fines can overextract due to the full immersion process and cause a lot more bitter flavours to be present.</p>

<p>Filtering out inconsistent coffee grounds results in a much more evenly extracted coffee as the majority of grounds will extract more uniformly without any under or over extracting much more than the rest. This should give a much more balanced and bodied cup assuming other variables are as diligently controlled.</p>

<p>Better grinders can minimise fines but an extra step can ensure particle size consistency. However I'm not sure about the extent of adverse effects of exposing ground coffee to air for so long would be to which I would suggest minimising grounds-sifting time.</p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1QdvN.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1QdvN.jpg"" alt=""Wine bottle storage""></a></p>

<p>I place my freshly roasted beans into an empty wine bottle and then vacuum pump it for storage. The special rubber stoppers have a one-way valve in them which allows air to be removed and held under a partial vacuum.  The advantage of this method is two fold.  First, the container is as full of beans as I can get it which minimizes the space available for air (oxygen is the bad guy).  After pumping out the air with the little hand pump, it creates a partial vacuum which extracts additional oxygen from the bottle but also promotes the accelerated off-gassing of carbon dioxide.  I know the beans are emitting CO2 because for the first day or two I can continue to pump out gas from the bottle.  After that, the bottle holds a vacuum indefinitely.</p>

<p>I've stored freshly roasted beans like this for at least a couple of weeks with no noticeable loss of flavor.  After I open the bottle and begin to use the beans, I can re-seal it; although the more space there is in the bottle, the more oxygen will remain in the bottle even after I pump it out.  After using a couple of days worth, I more often transfer it to a zip lock baggie that I can roll up and extract air from.  </p>

<p>Longer storage than a couple of weeks I can't comment on because I don't roast coffee that far in advance.  I prefer my coffee as freshly roasted as possible.</p>

  <p>I really enjoy the AeroPress, but over the past three years I have had to purchase 2 presses because of damage to the inner lining of the cylinders. After about 6 months or so of use, scratches and then cracks appeared in the cylinder walls.<br>

<p>Here is the AeroPress response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The crazing shown in your photo is a rare occurrence with an AeroPress coffee maker.  I know you have been unlucky to have it occur twice but it really does happen way less than 1% of the time.  We are working to learn what manufacturing process conditions coupled with certain use conditions cause the problem.  Send us your mailing address and we will send you a replacement chamber plus a new seal so we can make sure we get your AeroPress back to working properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>AeroPress did send me a replacement and it developed the same ""crazing"" (as AeroPress described) after 9 months. I was going to write to them again, but I had an extra AeroPress that I'd purchased for my son, but he'd never used. I've been using this press for over a year and although it has developed a few scratches the plastic seems to be holding up as I would expect.</p>

<p>Anyway, hopefully this adds a bit to the info/background about this issue.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: April 2018</strong></p>

<p>After seven years of using the AeroPress (starting in 2011), it looks like I've FINALLY obtained a durable version that lasts more than a year. My current AeroPress (shown in the photo below) started brewing coffee on 22-MAR-2017 and is still going strong, with NO damage to the cylinder. The cylinder's milky, opaque plastic differs from my four (4) previous AeroPress cylinders, which were all smokey, clear plastic (like the 2014 photo that I sent to AeroPress). All of the smokey, clear cylinders developed abrasions (what AeroPress called ""crazing"") after 6-9 months of use and all became unusable (not holding any pressure) after 9-12 months.</p>

<p>Nothing about my coffee preparation (using ground Peet's coffee and water heated to the 180 degrees) and clean-up process (wash everything immediately after each brewing) has changed, so I feel confident that something about the cylinder's chemical composition and/or manufacturing process has been modified to cause this positive change. :-)</p>

<p>Whenever you are extracting something into water, the temperature plays a couple different roles. First, higher temperatures generally increase the solubility of <em>most</em> compounds. Higher temperature water generally means more of everything gets dissolved, good and bad.Using cold water doesn't entirely solve the problem, since the lower solubility can leave a lot of great flavors behind.</p>

<p>Higher temperature can cause the breakdown of proteins, but I would doubt this is a significant source.After all, the beans were already roasted at high temperature before you ever got to the brewing part and the majority of the breakdown probably happened there.</p>

<p>I think you've got the right idea with circulating water at some intermediate temperature; you'd probably get the best of both cold and hot brew after you play with the temperatures a bit to find the best one for your tastes. The lower the temperature, the more flavors left behind and the longer you may have to brew to get to an adequate strength.</p>

The espresso machine comes with two types of filters (for singles and doubles), and can dispense a pre-programmed volume of water corresponding to a single or double dose through its two front buttons (the machine also allows programming these volumes, if desired.)</p>

<p>Thus there are 4 combinations of coffee I could produce:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose (~30 ml, as I understand).</li>
<li>Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a single dose.</li>
<li>Using a single filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose (~60 ml, as I understand).</li>
<li>Using a double filter, and dispensing water corresponding to a double dose.</li>
</ol>

<p>Are any of these 4 cases not usual or ""recommended""? Particularly I never brew the combination corresponding to case 3.</p>

<p>What is the expected flavor profile of the espresso produced in each of these cases (more/less acid, sour, sweet, etc.)?</p>

<p>Which of these could be called a ristretto, normale, or lungo?</p>

<p>What parameters should I aim for in each of these cases, in terms of: mass of grounds in the filter before brewing (in g), shot volume (in ml) or mass (in g) in the cup, and extraction time (in s)? I have heard extraction times should be always 25 s regardless of the coffee dose and the volume of water, so 25 s for all combinations above.</p>

<p>This machine has a pressure gauge, indicating water pressure during extraction. Should I watch for a particular value in this gauge, or ignore it and just watch the extraction time? Currently my procedure for adjusting the grind is to make it coarser when pressure is in the upper 2/3rds of the gauge range, and finer when pressure is in the lower 1/3rd of the gauge range. I do not regularly monitor extraction time for adjusting the grind. Using combination 4, and adjusting the grind such that the pressure gauge stays close to the midpoint, extraction times are in the range of 25-30 s. However, using the same grind settings but dosing enough water for a single (combination 2), extraction times are closer to 15 s. To get closer to 25 s I would have to let the pressure gauge reach values way into the upper range.</p>

<p>In closing: although I enjoy the taste of combination 2, it appears most of the water stays in the coffee puck, and the volume actually dispensed in the cup is very small (about 15-20 ml). Perhaps I should reprogram the water volume to get something closer to, say, 30 ml? Would this help me get an extraction time closer to 25 s for this dose (assuming this is the ""ideal"" extraction time)?</p>

<li>Sweetness/sourness - brew competitors use lowered brewing temps to increase the acidities in their coffee. But for me, grind size and exposure time, more than brew temp, allows you to tweak the flavor better in your coffee. So just grab that water off the boil and don't stress.</li>

<p>At a medium grind as suitable for a drip coffee maker (Baratza #20), I find the pre/post grind ratio is close to 1:1. At a finer grind as suitable for an AeroPress (Baratza #14), the ground coffee is significantly less dense. A finer grind makes a lower packing density.</p>

<p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Weigh the ground coffee and compare that to the weight of ground coffee that you used to use so the density variation between beans won't be a factor. (Reportedly, darker roasts are less dense than lighter roasts because roasting removes water.)</p>

<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Then you can focus on adjusting the grinder. Grind size makes a big difference in the resulting taste. As @wearashirt noted, it sounds like you need a finer grind to get your desired results.</p>

<p>By doing a <a href=""http://www.sensorysociety.org/knowledge/sspwiki/pages/triangle%20test.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">triangle test</a>, I found that 1 adjustment step makes a reliably noticeable difference between grind #20 (my favorite) and #21 (second choice) using a Baratza Encore burr grinder. This grinder's adjustment goes from #0 to #40, and a +1 difference is too small to discern visually. First do side-by-side non-blind comparisons of grind sizes since that's faster than a triangle test.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Inexpensive</strong> — a Bodum press will cost you around $35</li>
<li><strong>Easy to use</strong> — just add coffee and water</li>
<li><strong>Quantity</strong> — easy to make enough to share if you buy one of the larger varieties</li>
<li><strong>Thicker viscosity</strong> — produces a heavier mouthfeel and oils from the coffee are preserved</li>
</ul>

<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cleaning</strong> — Slightly more rinsing required than with pour over coffee (but less than espresso)</li>
<li><strong>Loss of some subtly</strong> — All the ""fines"" (tiny coffee particles that contribute to the thicker mouthfeel) present in the coffee cause some of the lighter taste notes to be glossed over.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to screw up:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Grind size</strong> — You need a very course grind size about the consistency of sea salt. Any finer and the coffee will turn into bitter sludge.</li>
<li><strong>Water temperature</strong> — Boiling-hot water will scorch the beans; it's best to bring water to a boil and then let it cool for 60 seconds before using (200F is the ideal temperature).</li>
<li><strong>Over extraction</strong> — After adding coffee and water, set a time for 4 minutes, plunge, and then immediately decant into mugs. Letting the coffee continue to sit in the press (even with the plunger pressed down) will result in bitterness.</li>

<p>For long time storage you might want to clean the pot a bit more. Cooking some water through your moka pot without coffee is the way to go. You repeat this process several times until you are sure the water that comes out is just water.
After this process it is a good idea to dry the pot as much as you can. This includes leaving the lower half on the stove with a little water until it has all evaporated. This prevents any mould growth as this is the most likely site for mould growth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The two factors behind the curdling of soy milk are <em>acidity</em> and <em>temperature</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can <em>reduce the acidity</em> via the <strong>choice of coffee beans, grind size,</strong> and other brewing variations.</p>

<p>You can <em>lower the temperature</em> by <strong>letting the coffee cool</strong> before adding soy milk or <strong>gradually adding the coffee to the soy milk.</strong> The latter cools the coffee with air and with the total mass of cold soy milk, and also reduces the number of soy milk molecules that get heated to the critical temperature by hot coffee.</p>

<p>(2) <strong>Froth the soy milk</strong> before adding the coffee. Frothing in air makes it a nice thermal insulator, increases its surface area, and changes the surface tension. As a result, less if any soy milk will curdle. <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2029/2908"">Frothing has additional benefits.</a> A <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?ie=UTF-8#q=handheld%20milk%20frother&amp;tbm=shop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hand-held frother</a> works for me.</p>

<p>According to this <a href=""http://coffeegeek.com/guides/frothingguide/steamguide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Milk Frothing Guide</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Properly prepared milk is always foamed. Even if you don’t want any foam in the drink you want to foam the milk just slightly. Incorporating air into the milk improves and sweetens the taste. Milk that has not been foamed at all tends to taste flat and dull by comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(3) Experiment with <strong>different kinds of milk substitutes</strong>. If I recall correctly, coconut milk didn't curdle while hemp milk curdled easily. There's also almond milk, almond-cashew milk, rice milk, hazelnut milk, and oat milk. Hemp milk doesn't froth up very well, at least not the brand I tried.</p>

<p>For safety, I would give it mixed results. It's not going to explode like an old school pressure cooker unless you leave it to boil dry, which would definitely take a while, even if you only put in an inch of water, and it does have an escape valve on the handle to reduce that kind of craziness. It does get hot, so you do have to watch where you put your hands, though if you keep the burner low/narrow flame as you heat it, the handles stay cool to the touch. I didn't feel comfortable with it for the first few times I used it, and did hit my knuckle against a hot bit the first time I used it, but I figured out that because I'm left handed, if I orient it with the steam wand pointing left, it's fine. Probably more flexible for me than a standard machine. </p>

<p>I agree that you can fill it only about an inch, and have it heat much more quickly. And with that smaller amount of water you can do a handful of drinks, in my experience. You might have to put it back on the burner for a very short time between drinks to bump it back up to steam, but you only use a small amount of the water each time to steam. </p>

3013,1,,2016-08-16T18:00:06.787,7,252,"<p>TL;DR:  Is there any science or data to support coffee that has undergone longer roast cycles needing less rest/degas time?</p>

<p>For some time, I have been doing my own roasting by cranking the machine to max temp, letting it rip, then stopping the roast when I am just short of my desired target and letting it coast to finish in the cool down cycle.  For almost all varietals of beans, my target roast levels end up in the 14:30 to 16:00 minute range for a half pound of green coffee beans.  Recently, however, I have been experimenting with significantly longer roasts (~30% to 50% longer).  I set the machine to max (482F) let it run 12 minutes or so, then crank it down to 425F or so and run to just short of target.  Generally this has been adding 4 to 8 minutes to my roasts times.  </p>

<p>The obvious disadvantage is the extra time it takes me to be involved with the roast.  The advantage I was going for was that it is much easier to hit a target roast with such a long window at the ""end of roast"".  However, I seem to notice another potential advantage.  The coffee seems to taste much better after much shorter rest times.  With my old shorter method coffees came into their peak seemingly around 72 to 96 hours later.  With this new method, the coffee seems to be hitting that same stride at 24 or 48 hours.  This is anecdotally supported by the fact that the air tight jars I keep my beans in are noticeably less ""poppy"" when I open them to degas the day after roasting.</p>

<p>I can think of several reasons why this may be a thing, most just involving equations for the behaviors of gasses at various temperatures, but does anyone have a more solid reason why this might be?  Or evidence that's it's all in my head (or taste buds) and just bunk?</p>

3018,2,,2016-08-17T14:08:11.037,4,,"<p>There are a few principles involved here (a chemical engineer's perspective on leaching - essentially coffee brewing is just that).</p>

<p>As Eli mentioned, solubility in water for most materials increases with temperature. In this case of leaving a batch of coffee with a batch of water (assume pure water for simplicity), materials (different components) will diffuse out of the coffee driven by concentration differences for each materials in water and in the ground coffee. There is a constant exchange of these materials going from the ground coffee into water and going from what has gone into water back to the ground coffee. Each material has its own diffusion rate and solubility in water for a given temperature. Eventually, there will be an equilibrium. Thus, assuming no chemical reaction takes place for now, no matter how long you leave that brew, temperature alone will dictate how much of each material in the coffee stays in the water and how much stays in the ground coffee. Without facts, qualitatively, I imagine an overnight brew in the fridge will give you more than enough time to reach that equilibrium and brewing it for another day or two will not change anything.</p>

<p>However, many organic components will hydrolyse to some degree when exposed to water especially when there is a pH shift. I do not know enough to speculate on which component in the coffee will face what kind of hydrolysis at what temperature, but generally the hydrolysis reaction rate increases with temperature. I am speculating that undesirable flavours are about both products of hydrolysis and increased solubility of ""bad"" components. There is also the likelihood of other reactions at higher temperatures say between acids and lipids or proteins and sugars or perhaps the breakdown of polysaccharides into shorter sugars and oxidation of sugars to acids and so on. These are much more likely to produce flavours than denaturing of proteins which I think (not certain) tends to have little to no impact.</p>

<p>In order to systematically visualise this, I think one would go through a matrix of temperature, time and grind size and put the ""extract"" through an HPLC to quantify the concentration of each component. Ultimately, a sensitive nose/tongue is the real test.</p>

<p>Extrapolating from this, I always feel that the drip method has to be the least desirable as you are constantly putting pure water to leach out materials from the coffee, always encouraging more materials to come out leaving no room for ""bad"" stuff to be left behind. If you taste the drip as the brewing progresses, you can definitely tell that about half way through, the coffee actually tastes foul and it gets worse. This is a leaching process designed to maximise extraction. This is exactly what happens at the fresh solvent end of an industrial counter-current extraction process to maximise concentration gradient and diffusion rate - not what you want for just taking the desirable bits out of coffee. It would be preferable to recirculate the brew through the grounds so that ""strength"" builds up to an equilibrium and by adjusting the temperature, you can control that equilibrium to achieve ""optimal"" taste.</p>

<p>I have been experimenting with cold brew and find that the brew tends to lack aroma while hot brew tends to have both a harsher taste and distorted aroma. Ideally, if there is a way to preserve the aroma of freshly roasted beans, that would be best. So far, I favour as fine a grind as practical, start with room temperature water, agitate and gradually raise the temperature to above 60C (have not found the preferred temperature yet but I dare not push it over 90C) nearer to the time of drinking. Once filtered, I can heat or chill the coffee as desired.</p>

<hr>

<p>(<em>Editor's note:</em> Additionally, an anonymous user suggested the following content...)</p>

<p>Cold/warm brew is much more forgiving, relying on achieving some equilibrium and making grind size and time redundant variables. Hot brew on the other hand for everyday coffee making is mostly about guessing when to stop the leaching process abruptly.</p>

<p>Fine grind is sometimes falsely blamed for over-extraction bitterness. From my experience, bitterness from fine grind has mostly to do with small coffee solids staying suspended in the coffee. It is very telling if you make coffee using a fine grind (say espresso grind) in a press/cafetier, pour a third into a cup as control, another third through a filter, and double filter the remainder, you will be able to taste the difference.</p>

3029,2,,2016-08-23T10:53:19.710,5,,"<p>One of the reasons I like my French Press is because of the caffeine boost. One simple answer to your question is to add more coffee grounds.</p>

<p>But aside from the type and amount of coffee used there are several things that will influence the caffeine level of your coffee. One of them is the size of the ground. You need a ground big enough that it is filtered out but not so big that the water doesn't completely extract the oils and caffeine.</p>

<p>You might try different grind levels and see which one works best.</p>

<p>Another thing you can do is increase steep time. If your grinds are just a bit too large perhaps a 6 minute steep would work better.</p>

<p>You will have to experiment with the grind and steep time.</p>

<p>I have actually been going through a French-press phase recently (starting with the drip coffee maker being unintentionally left to mold over a vacation, but I have not gone back to it even after cleaning it throughly.) I'm using the same coffee I was using in the drip, and it appears to have the same effects. I generally don't let the water get all the way to boiling - I don't like scalding hot coffee and I don't concern myself too much with made-up standards that ""coffee water is supposed to be 204F"" - and I don't even measure the temperature, just listen to the kettle for a change in the sound, and touch the side lightly to see if it's hot. I've gone as short as 2 and as long as 10 minutes for hot brews. I would say you seem rather light on the amount of coffee - I probably use twice what you do.</p>

<p>...or put your coffee in the night before and add cold water, leave for many hours. Depending on how fussy you are(n't) about cold brewing, put in fridge or leave on the counter. No additional foolish ""cold-brew"" equipment required. It's fine, but I don't find it to be some sort of coffee nirvana that makes me never want to drink hot-brewed coffee ever again. It also has the caffeine, and plenty of time to extract it.</p>

<p>My favorite is ""Vermont Coffee"" - ie, use maple syrup (or sugar, but syrup is more cost-effective, at least near a production area where the cost is not much shipping.) </p>

<p>Friends in the UK introduced me to Demerara, which is a not-quite fully refined sugar with a delicate carmel taste. Some of the ""raw sugar"" products sold in the USA approximate this, and some better than others. </p>

<p>Plain old white sugar is what it is, and if that's what you want, that's fine too.</p>

<p>I certainly have no difficulty distinguishing all of these from each other, in coffee - your taste buds/nose may vary.</p>

3039,2,,2016-08-25T18:24:54.880,6,,"<p>Instant coffee suffers from a number of drawbacks that put it on the far end of the spectrum from well raised and processed, properly roasted and freshly ground coffee.  To start with, instant coffee is usually made from the cheapest and lowest quality beans.  These beans are then (usually) roasted and brewed on large industrial equipment.  The coffee is then dehydrated into a powder.  While dehydrating food and beverages is great for long term storage and portability, it generally doesn't improve (or even maintain) the flavor of the food and drink being freeze dried.  </p>

<p>Basically the market/prices for most instant coffee dictate that it will be produced with the lowest possible costs.  Meaning marginal beans are sourced and put through a bunch of horrific processing to make a marginal product.  Add that to the fact that it's only ""easier"" in a very limited amount of circumstances and one can understand it's limited popularity.  While it may be less time intensive than the process one goes through to brew their own coffee, it is actually more time/labor intensive than stopping at a drive through coffee shack or grabbing a cup from a communal pot at work, which is how many people source their coffee.  </p>

<p>While there may be a few companies out there striving to produce high quality instant coffee, the majority is not of high quality and the truth of it's ""not that much easier"" existence means that overall it suffers from low reputation.  </p>

3040,2,,2016-08-25T20:53:29.397,3,,"<p>Funnily enough, I often find espresso based coffees don't provide the same jolt in the morning, whereas coffee from a cafetiere does. However, keeping on topic, there is a lot of personal preference involved when it comes to coffee, and it could be that the taste isn't triggering that wake up moment for you.</p>

<p>As @Ecnerwal mentioned, there are ""standards"" regarding temperature which may or may not suit your tastes. Like @Ecnerwal, my approach to brewing coffee is to listen to the sound of the kettle. Sometimes I miss the cues and the kettle boils, in which case I add some cold water to the grounds before the boiled water. I find that, most of the time, I prefer coffee brewed at a much lower temperature than the ""standard"" as it has a deeper, heavier flavour, but go too low and it tastes flat to me.</p>

<p>Then there is brewing time. My basic approach used to be to grind 3 tablespoons of beans, add the water, wait ~1m40, one big stir quickly near the surface, wait ~1m40 and then press and drink. At some point I realised that the stir could be left out if I left the coffee to stand for longer (which makes sense based on how caffeine extraction works). The taste was equally satisfying, but 4 minutes without stirring just wouldn't do it for me.</p>

<p>Of course, there is the coffee itself. Whenever I get a new batch of coffee there is a degree of trial and error regarding time, quantity, temperature for me to get it right. Less so if I buy a blend, more so  single origin. Different coffee has slightly different needs. Then there is the whole Arabica/Robusta/Other debate. Robusta seems to have a bad name, but you might actually prefer the taste and it generally has more caffeine content. One of the best coffees I have ever had was 100% robusta from a local roasters, and it certainly packed a caffeine punch.</p>

<p>Finally, the problem might not be a matter of coffee but a matter of ritual. That big sense of relief for me comes with the first sip of coffee, before it can possibly have had any physical effect. The very idea of having coffee does the trick. In no way dismissing your experience, it is possible it is the result of a changed perception towards your coffee, rather than the caffeine content itself.</p>

3049,2,,2016-08-30T02:42:18.250,8,,"<p>I have been roasting with the FreshRoast SR 500 for several months and have seen wildly differing advice from a variety of sources.  Recently I found information from a few sources that when combined have resulted in some really nice roasts.</p>

<p>The first piece of information I found was the temperatures for the heat settings of the FreshRoast SR 500:</p>

<pre><code>|  Setting  |  Temp  |
| :-------- | :----- |
|  High     |  490   |
|  Medium   |  455   |
|  Low      |  390   |  
</code></pre>

<p>The second piece of information I found was the temperature at which coffee beans begin a process called pyrolysis.  At about 400 degrees Fahrenheit pyrolysis begins in coffee beans.  Pyrolysis is the process of chemical change within the bean that generates heat.  When this process happens in coffee we hear it as a popping sound known as first crack.</p>

<p>In the SR 500 a temperature setting of Medium is high enough to raise coffee beans to this temperature.  I had been using a high heat setting to roast coffee, and the resulting beans had a very smoky flavor, which was not very pleasant.</p>

<p>Additional research yielded some additional wisdom that I find sound.</p>

<pre><code>1. Apply adequate energy at the beginning of a roast
2. Make sure that the bean temperature progression always decelerates
3. Make sure that first crack begins at 75% to 80% of total roast time
</code></pre>

<p>This information is sound when trying to roast to a City or City+ level, which is fortunate for me as I am aiming for a nice medium roast for pour over coffee.</p>

<p>According to an information card I received from Sweet Maria's with my first order of coffee from them, city/city+ is achieved at the tail end of first crack at a temperature range of 415 to 435 degrees.</p>

<p>Applying adequate energy at the beginning of a roast is not the problem with the FreshRoast SR 500.  I find that the roaster applies too much energy and roasts much too fast.  If anything, I needed to find a way to slow down the drying phase, as the beginning of the roast is often called, and developed a procedure for stretching that out with this roaster.</p>

<p>I start by using an interval timer app on my tablet designed for use with interval training exercise to precisely time the steps in my process.  To slow down the initial drying process I alternate heating for twelve seconds and cooling for six seconds and repeat this cycle for twenty-four intervals.  The interval timer helps me remember what step I'm on and prompts me to switch the roaster from heating to cooling and back precisely.  During this phase I apply only low heat with the fan speed on high.  I also physically lift the roaster base and tilt the roaster several degrees away from vertical and rotate the roaster around its vertical axis.  This agitates the green beans in the chamber and helps prevent scorching.  I roast batches of 90 grams and find that this batch size also prevents scorched beans.</p>

<p>A decelerating temperature progression means that the rate of temperature rise should slow down during the roast.  It doesn't mean that the temperature should lower but that the rate of temperature increase should be faster earlier in the roast and slower later in the roast.  When the beans reach first crack there is a spike in bean temperature from the heat being generated internally by pyrolysis.  In anticipation of first crack and knowing that the roaster will not respond instantly to changes in heat settings, I lower the heat just prior to first crack.</p>

<p>The advice to make sure that first crack begins between 75% and 80% of total roast time is only a guideline, but I find that adhering to it gives me very nice coffee.  So with all of this information up front, here is how I apply it with the FreshRoast SR 500.</p>

<p>I begin by preheating the roaster using high heat and the fan control at the 3 O'clock position.  This allows all of the roaster parts to absorb as much heat as they can and prevents the roaster from sucking heat away from the beans.  I follow a set rhythm while roasting one 90-gram batch at a time.  While the beans are being cooled by the roaster after completing the roasting cycle I weigh out the next 90-gram batch.  When the roaster stops I immediately pour out the beans into a tray, turn the roaster back on using low heat and low fan speed, clean out the chaff collector, and load the next batch of beans into the roast chamber.</p>

<p>Preheat the roaster for 2 full cycles at a fan speed of 3 O'clock and using high heat.  Run the roaster on low heat and low fan speed between batches.</p>

<p>Start with a roast time of 2.8 minutes.  Roast 90 grams per batch.</p>

<pre><code>|  Description         |  Heat    |  Fan Speed  | 
| :------------------- | :------: | :---------: |
|  \*Drying Cycle      |  Low     |  High       |
|  @  1.9              |  Medium  |  1 O'clock  |
|  @  1.1 (FC) \*note  |  Low     |  ""          |
|  @  0.5              |  ""       |  3 O'clock  |
|  B4 End of FC        |  Cool    |  High       |
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Drying Cycle</em>: Alternate heating for 12 seconds and cooling for 6 seconds.  Tilt the roaster several degrees from its vertical axis and rotate it around that axis during this process.  Repeat this for twenty-four iterations.  Continue rotating the roaster until the first sign of first crack.</p></li>
<li><p><em>note</em>: Stop rotating the roaster at the first sign of first crack.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there is plenty of room for improvement in my procedure.  Adding a thermocouple and noting the temperature during the roast would be very helpful in knowing what is happening while roasting.  Sweet Maria's sells one along with a battery and a temperature probe as a package that is cheaper than what Amazon will charge you for the same components.  It's about $30 from them.</p>

<p>I hope this helps either you or anyone else that might be looking for information for the FreshRoast SR 500.</p>

So, I decided to use the advantages of sitting in an academic office and sought the academic databases I can think of. Some of them are only accessible by abstract. However, I will try to copy the essence of them here without disturbing copyright rules of the publishers.</em></p>

<p>First things first, I tried to understand the effect of going stale to the amount of antioxidants in coffee. It seems not.</p>

<p>My first reference is <em>""Antioxidant capacity, phenolic acids and caffeine contents of some commercial coffees available on the Romanian market.""</em> by Trandafir I., Nour V, and Ionica M.E. which you can read its abstract <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24167962"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. According to this article, total amount of antioxidants <strong>in a regular coffee sold in the market</strong> is changing in between <strong>19.8 to 41.9 mg per gram</strong> coffee.</p>

<p>My second reference is <em>""Recovery of Natural Antioxidants from Spent Coffee Grounds""</em> by Alessia Panusa, Antonio Zuorro, Roberto Lavecchia, Giancarlo Marrosu, and Rita Petrucci which you can read its abstract <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf4005719"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. According to this article, total amount of antioxidants <strong>in the remains of the spent espresso waste</strong> is changing in between <strong>17.07 to 35.52 mg per gram</strong> coffee.</p>

<p>I conclude that, even after brewing (chemically speaking; extraction or leaching) the antioxidant amount is not changing <em>much</em>.</p>

<p>Then, I tried to understand what changes the antioxidant level in coffee, if there exist something. Yes, there is one; here comes the third reference by Ayelign and Sabally, <em>""Determination of Chlorogenic Acids (CGA) in Coffee Beans using HPLC""</em> which you can download a copy of it from <a href=""http://www.usa-journals.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Ayelign_Vol12.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. In this study, it is shown that the level of CGAs (an antioxidant) is <strong>dropped from 46.144 mg to 0.981 mg per gram coffee, more the coffee is roasted</strong>.</p>

<p>I can only say that once I started measuring the coffee I have moved to coarser grind that what was originally recommended.   You have said you have tried coarse so I'm not sure what the issue might be.  I would maybe try to readjust your grinder by adjusting while it is running and empty.  Turn it all the way to fine and then open it back up to as coarse as you can make it, while the grinder is running.</p>

Instead though, the first cracks started around the three minute mark and continued for the next four minutes.  I can't tell if the second cracks ever started, since the sound never stopped from the first round.</p>

<p>The color and texture of the roasted beans is close to other store-bought beans, but they smell burnt.  I kept thinking I should take them off the heat but thought it might be too early and I hate weak coffee.</p>

3061,2,,2016-09-04T03:02:34.303,5,,"<p>Distinguishing between end of first crack and the start of second crack can be very tricky. A lot has to do with the variety of beans being roasted and your heat application.</p>

<p>What I think happened to you was that you lost control of your heat. At first crack your beans become exothermic (give off heat) and you didn't reduce your heat. What happened then is that you had too much heat at raced through the ""development"" time in your roast profile. 
To correct this you should reduce your heat at the start of first crack and develop the flavor by how much/long  you let the beans go for before taking them off the heat.
This is a critical time for your roast because your are developing the flavor in your roast by time and roast level. How you apply heat changes from variety to variety and darkness. 
Take the time to read up on roasting theory.</p>

3062,2,,2016-09-05T03:38:16.867,4,,"<p>I recently purchased the Bonavita as well. After years of using basic automatic drip coffee makers this was an adjustment. I still haven't perfected the art of the cup using the Bonavita. The problem is that the Bonavita brews at the correct temperature, so I think you really need to be a little more precise when brewing (at least that's what I discovered).</p>
<p>First of all, the Bonavita brews only 8 cups--and each cup is only 5 oz. I use a scale to get as close as I can to the correct water-coffee ratio. I no longer use a scoop: a scale is the way to go.</p>
<p>I have found that with the Bonavita a medium course grind is best. I also found that lighter roasts are less likely to produce the bitter flavor you are experiencing.</p>
<p>I usually brew at a water ratio of 1:14. So that means that I use about 84 grams of coffee for a full pot. I know, seems like a lot of coffee. i never used that much with my Mr. Coffee.  But, once you figure out the correct grind and amount, the Bonavita produces a great cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Go to <a href=""https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://baristahustle.com/the-coffee-compass/</a> and read the article. The &quot;Coffee Compass&quot; really helped me out in trying to get that great cup. Just the other day, I ground up some coffee at a slightly higher setting and the coffee was weak. So now, using that setting, I had to up the amount of coffee by a couple of grams and it was perfect. And that was thanks to the Coffee Compass.</p>
<p>It is so trial and error, I have to say.</p>
<p>Here are the basic ratios to use with the Bonavita. I have found that the 1:14 produces the better cup in my opinion. Also, lighter roasts tend to not be as bitter as the darker roasts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bonavita cup = 5 oz. (147.87 grams = 1 Bonavita cup or 29.574 grams an
ounce) Each cup = 5.215 ounces</p>
<p>4 Bonavita Cups = 20 oz = 591.47 g   (Ratios:  1:14=42 g; 1:15=39 g;
1:16=37 g) Note: Finer grind</p>
<p>5 Bonavita Cups = 25 oz = 739.33 g (Ratios:  1:14=53 g; 1:15=49 g; 1:16=46 g)</p>
<p>6 Bonavita Cups = 30 oz = 887.20 g   (Ratios:  1:14=63 g; 1:15=59 g; 1:16=55.45 g) Note: Medium grind</p>
<p>8 Bonavita Cups = 40 oz =1182.94 g  (Ratios:  1:14=84.5 g; 1:15=79 g; 1:16=74 g) Note: Courser grind</p>

Over-extracted coffee tastes bitter. Really badly over-extracted coffee can sometimes exhibit metallic or plastic taste.</p>

<p>Under-extraction is a much better option. The resulting coffee will be thicker, stickier and less bitter. The downside is that you are not getting the maximum utilisation from the beans and you could have made more acceptable coffee with those beans.</p>

<p>A ristretto is a short extraction with minimal water and ideally at a slightly lower pressure. An espresso should be the same coffee, but the extraction would use more water and often a slightly faster flow rate / higher pressure.</p>

<p>The caffeine content will mostly be dependent on the beans used and the quantity of coffee in the pod. A longer extraction may increase the caffeine content slightly, but not enough to be noticeable.</p>

<p>The factors that affect kopi luwak quality are the same as those that affect any other coffee. Namely, the quality of the coffee bean being grown, the processing of the beans, the roast and the storage conditions. Preparation is also important.</p>

<p>To summarize, the roasting process of coffee produces carbon dioxide inside the beans, which takes a while to find its way out. Sealing the coffee in tight containers would be problematic, as the carbon dioxide would stay in the beans in this way (making the coffee sour) or may let the bag burst over time.</p>

<p>However, not sealing coffee bags is not a solution either, as exposure to air lets the coffee get stale after a while. As supermarket coffee is unfortunately often stored for long period of time before sold, this would be problematic.</p>

<p>So the solution is to either (1) use a one-way valve that allows the carbon dioxide to escape from the bag without the air coming into the bag, or (2) to let the beans degas before sealing them airtight in bags. Solution (1) is probably best for fresh coffee, so it is used here. I don't know what problem is solved with such valves in pet food containers.</p>

So, here you will see the answer in a while. Most of you very probably will not like it. Still, I will also disclose the fact how you like it at first place. That's all science of coffee.</p>

<hr>

<p>It's widely known that, historically Turkey is one of the hubs of coffee trade and well-known for the Turkish-style brewing. However, this tradition is <em>unfortunately</em> not the best-known thing among the population in these days. Worse than that, the community is not self-aware of this. So, big merchants are using such ignorance as a benefit.</p>

<p>A few big roasters and coffee-houses known to prepare Turkish-coffee are somewhat built a monopoly on beans. The beans are mostly imported from Brazil and mostly the cheapest batches that are molding to keep the prices low. You can see two photos of some randomly chosen beans from a bag. These are six beans out of thirty, so the bad bean rate is around 20%. Imagine, when Ernesto Illy once said that one bean out of fifty in a cup spoils an espresso.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zD0E3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zD0E3.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlMeL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlMeL.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then comes the roasting. Luckily, the big roasters have nice roasters for big batches. However, if you are visiting a small local coffee shop, it is possible that they have still using a pan to roast and burning the flat side of the bean and cannot roast the curvy side.</p>

<p>Below, you can see a photo from one of the most popular shopping malls of Istanbul. You can clearly see the uneven roast. I don't even discuss the storage conditions here! The damp, the light, the air...</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTw7t.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTw7t.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Of course, the roast degree... Normally, cinnamon to city roast is the advised degree for proper Turkish coffee. However, bulk producers mostly goes beyond first crack, even to the second crack to hide the <em>moldy</em> flavors. The result is more like Vietnamese style; very dark roasted charcoal flavors. This is not what it used to be. However, the packaged roasted and ground Turkish coffee is mostly that.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, the question remains, what makes it special? How do you feel a mouthful when you taste it at the headquarters and cannot reproduce it at home?</p>

<p>The answer is, <strong>freshness</strong>. That's what you feel, in my opinion. Most bulk roasters do not even care about degassing as they are selling anyway. (This may affect the taste, I assume. They start grinding right after roasting to get rid of stock expenses.) They sell to the tourists or to the ignorant Turkish population. Still, at the end, when you visit their headquarters, you smell a very fragrant coffee flavor. This adds to the aroma you taste. (You know, they say onion and apple taste the same when you don't smell them.) Then, you drink a very fresh cup of coffee. This is very probably nice as it is just roasted, even if the beans were bad.</p>

<p>However, you buy a bag of very fine grounded over-roasted bad coffee. The bag itself does not have a one-way-valve or it is not filled with inert gases or it is not vacuum packed. Thus, it goes stale very rapidly. Note that, fine grounded coffee goes stale more quickly. Even during your trip to your home. So maybe you have one or two days to finish the bag, if not a few hours.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> There is nothing special about Turkish coffee. It goes stale stale just so quickly as it is grounded so fine. Commercially marketed Turkish coffee bags contain crap.</p>

<p>If you want to find the perfect roast degree, you may choose your specific beans first, specific brewing method, etc. Then choose the specific roast degree. After that, a spectrophotometer may help you to find that exact point each time you <em>repeat</em> the roasting process.

I chalked it up to a bad batch, but it turned out, since that day, all (or all that I've tried, including ones that used to be fine) have that smell and taste.</p>

<p>I figured it was something in the artificial flavoring used for hazelnut since actual hazelnuts (raw and roasted) don't have that flavor nor odor to me.</p>

<p>Today I just tried a coconut mocha coffee they had at my office as it looked interesting and I smelled the same exact odor. I tasted it anyway, and got the exact same taste as well. There was nothing hazelnut about this coffee.</p>

<p>So, I'm trying to figure out what exactly it is that I am perceiving as this smell/taste.  It's not actually hazelnuts and it's something that's in multiple flavored coffees, but definitely not all.</p>

<p>It's not coffee itself, and it's not a flavor that's in every flavored coffee (black coffee, cinnamon bun, blueberry, pumpkin spice, so far have all been fine)</p>

3130,2,,2016-10-04T23:43:57.247,1,,"<p>I am a home roaster and I've ruined my fair share of coffee beans learning just how to use my own roaster.  I use a hot air roaster, the Fresh Roast SR500 and I've done many hours of internet research to try and get a basic understanding of home roasting.  </p>

<p>The first basic principle of roasting is that you want the temperature of the beans to be constantly rising.  If the beans ever cool during the roast cycle, you've most likely ruined them.  It doesn't sound like this is a problem for you.</p>

<p>A second basic principle is that the heat should rise at a rate no faster than the full mass of the beans can absorb.  This means that the temperature needs to rise evenly in the whole bean, not just the outer part.  If the temperature rises too fast, the outer bean will begin to burn while the inner bean hasn't yet fully dried, so the whole batch is again ruined.  This sounds like what is happening to your roast.  </p>

<p>Commercial roasters and home roasters using drum roasters are able to roast large batches but at a slower rate than my hot air roaster.  This will give a particular flavor profile to a bean that my roaster won't be able to duplicate, primarily because my hot air roaster simply roasts too fast.  Nevertheless, I've been able to get very good results with my roaster by learning how to slow it down as much as necessary while still keeping the temperature rising throughout the roast cycle.</p>

<p>I've read in more than one place on roasting forums that first crack (FC) should occur somewhere around 75-80% of the way through the entire roast cycle and should last for as short a time as possible, generally less than 2-3 minutes.  My own current roast profile has FC starting around the 6 minute mark and I'm starting my cooling cycle at around 7:40 shortly after FC ends.  Not exactly the 75-80% time frame, but those folks are generally using drum roasters in the 15-20 minute range for a complete cycle.  They also recommend a roast time no shorter than 10 minutes, but again, that is for a drum roaster.  My coffee tastes fantastic with my current profile.  </p>

<p>If you get your bean temperatures to rise at a reasonable rate, there is a definite pause between first and second crack, and there is a distinct difference in the sounds of FC vs SC.  Since you are using a popcorn popper on a stove burner, I wouldn't be able to give you any better guidance than this, but your 1 cup of beans is relatively small, so I don't think these times are unreasonable.  I'm generally roasting 100 grams of raw beans per charge.  Your one cup sounds like it's probably I bit more than 100 grams.  </p>

<p>I would advise you to go online, search ""home coffee roasting forums"" and start reading.  I would also strongly advise you to start logging each and every batch you do as to times, weight of beans, heat levels, the outside temperature, smells you detect, what color your socks are, etc.  Just joking about the socks, of course, but the idea is that you'll begin to see some definite trends and you'll be able to home in on the right method for your setup much more quickly.</p>

<p>In short, definitely slow things down and aim for ending FC around 7:30 or later if possible.  End of FC generally equates to a medium roast level, although you'll find lots more information about that online as well.  Even with the benefit of the internet and lots of information on the forums, it still took me awhile to get my own setup to produce the results I was looking for so be patient.  Good luck!</p>

There is conjecture that the really efficacious part of a gastric bypass surgery is the gut reboot that happens afterwards rather than the actual surgical procedure.</p>

<p>I recently purchased of a Cuisinart DBM-8 (a basic automatic grinder) to replace an even more basic blade grinder. This grinder has allows for a grind amounts in increments of ""2 coffee cups"" starting from 4 cups.</p>

<p>My coffee did not become watery upon first use of the DBM-8. I usually brew using 16 to 20 fluid oz of water, and I have switched between the 4-cup and the 6-cup setting on the grinder. I found that the 6-cup setting tasted pretty good, but seemed to use up a lot of beans.</p>

<p>With all that said, what has happened for the past week is that coffee made using my brewer has been tasting watery, no matter if I use the 4-cup or the 6-cup grind setting, and whether I try more or less water.

3148,2,,2016-10-15T21:51:10.143,7,,"<p>I'll give some background, a hypothesis, and (more important) instructions to find out experimentally.</p>

<p>The experiment is easy and fun. I did experiments such as paper vs. bamboo filter, slightly different grind sizes, fresh beans vs. 7-weeks off roast, and different coffee:water ratios within the range of a scoop measurement (i.e. is it important to weigh the coffee?).</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lady tasting tea experiment</a> is at the start of modern statistics and randomized trials. (There's now a book, <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/Lady-Tasting-Tea-Statistics-Revolutionized-ebook/dp/B00633W4A2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century</a>.) The question was, “Does it matter to add tea to milk vs. milk to tea?” It turns out the answer is yes.</p>

<p><strong>Speculation and Hypothesis:</strong> Adding milk to tea lets significantly more milk get hotter than adding tea to milk does. That could enable more of it to react chemically, e.g. curdling. But that's unlikely with ice, so I'll bet adding ice to hot coffee vs. hot coffee to ice makes no discernable difference in taste. (Let's ignore the fact that dropping ice into hot coffee could splash out more hot coffee than the reverse.)</p>

<p><strong>How to Experiment:</strong> Do a <a href=""http://www.sensorysociety.org/knowledge/sspwiki/pages/triangle%20test.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Triangle Test</a> with 3 or more people. Make the iced coffee both ways, ""A"" and ""B"", keeping all other variables as constant as you can. Each person gets 3 cups, one of which is different than the other two, e.g. a sequence like A-B-A or B-B-A. Give a different random combination to each taster, of course without revealing it.</p>

<p>All tasters should start by tasting their 3 cups in order. Then they can go back and forth between cups as much as they like. Their job is to try to discern the difference and say which of the 3 cups tastes the most different. You might also ask them to state their preference. When they all make their choices, then you can reveal the combinations.</p>

<p><strong>The Math is Not Hard:</strong> If a taster gets it right, we really don't know if they were lucky or good. The default explanation (""null hypothesis"") for the combined test results is that they're within a reasonable range of random results. Dice would randomly get 1/3 of the choices right. If enough people got it right that the odds were <em>small enough</em> of dice getting a result that extreme or better, then we'll conclude the tasters can discern the difference. Different fields of science may use different thresholds. Pick a threshold before doing the experiment. A common standard for ""statistical significance"" is ≤ 5%.</p>

<p>With 3 tasters, if they all get it right, that's a 1/(3<sup>3</sup>) = 1/27 = 3.7% chance, which beats the 5% threshold.</p>

<p>If <em>K</em> of <em>N</em> tasters get it right, the calculation considers the number of ways to get <em>K</em> of <em>N</em> correct choices and the probability of each random choice being correct (1/3).</p>

<p>The Google Sheets formula for Probability{x ≥ K of N correct choices} is:</p>

<pre><code>=1 - BINOMDIST(K - 1, N, 1/3, TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>so if that value is ≤ 5%, we'll conclude that people can reliably taste the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> To prepare for an experiment, I make paper strips with the different test sequences. Whoever pours for taster <em>n</em> will pick a strip at random, pour those cups while out of view, stash the strip in a pocket, and bring it out after everyone has written down their tasting choices. There needs to be at least enough strips for the number of tasters, and usually a multiple of 6 strips since there are 6 possible sequences. But when there are only 3 tasters, I prune it to 2 sequences that have one A and two B's and 2 sequences that have one B and two A's, so we can't all get the same odd one out.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Each taster gets 3 cups of coffee, a spit cup, water, crackers, and a napkin. I put painter's tape on the coffee cups to mark consistent fill lines and to label them 1, 2, and 3.</p>

Using forced air might help if you think the beans aren't getting even temp distribution. I don't use forced air. The thermal mass of the grill cavity along with the bean rotation seems to distribute the temperate quite evenly. Wherever you place the probe, as long as you can get a consistent and reliable reading you should be able to build your roast profiles accordingly.

3161,2,,2016-10-20T14:01:38.587,1,,"<p>First of all I strongly agree with the statements that what doesn't taste good to you may be delicious to other people. Secondly as an enthusiastic coffee drinker and also as someone working with coffee, I find the amount of bad coffee around just astonishing.</p>

<p>The flavor of the coffee you have in your cup is determined by a wide range of variables, beginning with the species of coffee (arabica vs. robusta), the origin of the bean, the processing after harvest, the roast and finally everything that has to do with the preparation of your cup o' Jo like the grind and extraction time. Bitterness in coffee has two main reasons and is in fact not a desired yet very common flavor. The first reason is due to the roasting process where the chemical compounds in the coffee are broken down and can create a bitter and unpleasant taste. <a href=""http://www.coffeeresearch.org/science/bittermain.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> you'll find some chemical background info on bitterness in coffee. This is typical for very dark over-roasted coffee. Dark roasts tend to lose some of the flavor that is typical to the bean you are using and instead introduces exogenous flavors through the process of roasting itself (through Maillard reactions). Check <a href=""https://www.kaladicoffee.com/about-our-coffee/bitterness-and-acidity/"" rel=""nofollow"">this source</a> for some info and nice illustration of the relationship between roasting and flavor.</p>

<p>However the arguably more important factor, assuming you are using a light to medium roast which is typical for most speciality coffee is the time of extraction. With extraction I mean roughly the duration in which the water is in contact with your coffee grounds (in reality it is more complex). Depending on the type of preparation this may take between 20-30s for espresso shots, up to several minutes for pour-overs (2-3min for Hario V60, around 4min for Chemed) and even many hours for a cold brewed coffee. If the contact time between water and grounds is too long you will over extract your coffee which results in the bitterness you didn't like. On the other side, underextraction results in sourness. A well extracted coffee should be sweet, fruity, have some acidity and very little bitterness. Most of the coffee you get in coffee shops is over-extracted in my experience.</p>

<p>So it may be that the bitterness you are describing is in fact just due to a bad coffee you had. I suggest you try some good coffee and you might just like it. Or maybe you won't which is also fine. Most people I know who drink coffee do it for the caffein and the kick they get out of it in the morning (I'd rather have some green or black tea if that's the only purpose). I personally drink coffee because I love the great variety and complexity of flavors. A well sourced and well prepared cup of coffee can be something really beautiful to use your words. It starts with the farmers though who spend a lot of effort in cultivating the best possible cherries, or with the roasters who only use the best grade beans and it ends with the barista who knows what's behind the coffee they prepare and how best to do so. I can not stand the very dark, over extracted coffee that you seem to describe. It is bitter, ashy, hollow and it actually just baffles me that people still drink it.</p>

3162,2,,2016-10-20T14:56:25.897,4,,"<p>Well this is a strange problem but it seems to have to do with the new grinder you are using or the way you use it since the grind is the only variable that has changed (according to your story).</p>

<p>Watery coffee most often means that you don't use enough ground coffee. Try using 6g of coffee per 100ml of water for a medium roast. If the roast is very light you may use a slightly higher coffee to water ratio. If it is not the quantity of coffee it is probably the grinder setting. Try a finer grind, something between table salt and sand (probably just the medium-fine setting on your grinder, however do check with your fingers). The problem may be what was suggested in the comments. If the grind is too coarse, the water is just running through the coffee and doesn't leave the time to spread and steep. This is in line with the hole in the center of the coffee bed you are describing. Maybe try to measure the time the coffee needs to run through and see if it changes if you grind finer.</p>

<p>If this doesn't help then I'd suggest you properly clean the spout and make sure the water is dripping out the way it is supposed to. Maybe scale has built up which is channeling the water, forcing it through the spout in a stream that hits the coffee grounds with too much pressure.</p>

<p>I suggest you try all of the above which will most likely solve your problem. Additionally however you could cut up some standard paper filters and place them on the ground coffee so that it is completely covered. In theory the water should then distribute much more evenly through the grounds. I'd suggest you do this only <strong>after</strong> you have solved the general problem as a means to improve the flavor. It'd definitely be a quite ""hacky"" solution and I think first of all your machine should work the way it is supposed to.</p>

  Ground Coffee Beans: The Pros &amp; Cons
  </a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that when you buy ground coffee you may be sacrificing a little flavor but you’re saving yourself valuable time (in the morning that can make all the difference in the world—we’re talking to you sleepyheads!). If you prefer the convenient route, we do have a few tips to get the most out of the grounds you buy:</p>

<p>Buy a week’s worth of grounds at a time to insure you’ll get the most flavors out of your ground beans.
    Store your grounds properly away from coffee killers. Our Roasterie   AirScape Container is like a coffee bodyguard.</p>

<pre><code>Whole Coffee Beans: Nothin’ But Pros
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to get the most flavorful coffee possible, recommend buying your beans whole. Grinding is a crucial, yet overlooked component of the brewing process. It’s not as simple as just grinding the beans in any old coffee grinder. An even grind is the perfect grind. If you don’t have a good grinder, you won’t extract enough flavor out of the beans. Blade grinders can’t provide an even grind so when hot water for brewing passes over the ground, it’s passing over an uneven surface area.</p>

<p>We recommend that if you decide to grind beans yourself, get a burr or mill grinder. These types of grinders grind the coffee in an even consistency. Uniform consistency is essential when it comes to extracting the most flavor out of your coffee beans.</p>

<p>When it comes to purchasing our beans, it doesn’t really matter whether you buy them whole or ground. We’ll make sure that no matter what way you choose to buy them, you’ll receive the best beans possible!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PS: `ground size is important as well, all depends what you try to get from your cup of coffee:
  1.grounding too <strong>fine</strong> can lead to have coffee beans part in our cup.</p>
  
  <p>2.<strong>fine ground</strong> will lead to much more <em>caffeine</em> content(can say about the espresso type requirement), too fine can lead to higher compression in the espresso machine and can be dangerous. </p>

All being said: <strong>coffee</strong> should be more than an awake call in the morning, should be <strong>ART</strong> and as much you research/try methods, starting from ground home and moving to home roast, you'll be amazed by the taste and types, flavors from all around the world. :)

Fresh roasted beans are ""fresh"" for approximately two weeks (you find varying data|opinions on this).  Ground coffee is ""fresh"" for several hours (you will also find varying data|opinions on this, but it's generally much shorter). </p>

<p>Grind size (combined with immersion) time has a direct and noticeable impact on the final cup product.  Finer grinds (and longer immersion times) produce a different flavor profile than coarser grind and short immersion times.  Then there are cross over examples like espresso which gets a unique profile by using a fine grind and short extraction time (perhaps the shortest).  There are several questions on the site relating to how grind size, immersion time and temperature affect flavor profile.   </p>

<p>We've all seen that aeropress <em>sometimes</em> produces a foamy, oily, tasty product on top of its shot and sometimes not. Without entering a geek war of whether this is or isn't traditional crema, let's just assume that this is what the OP wants when talking about crema so we can all be on the same page.</p>

<p>Using the inverted method, the crema is the last thing to come out of press because it's lighter than the coffee hence why it floats to the top. However, if you leave an air gap when you fit the cap and then flip the press without removing the air gap then the last thing to come out of the press will be this air. </p>

<p>Furthermore, if you wait until you hear the air escaping when you're pressing down, which will be once the coffee liquid has all come through, and then hold the press horizontally as you squeeze out the ""air"" then inside the press you will have: a small reservoir of coffee liquid; a pocket of air; and, in between, the crema. Since the press is now horizontal, all three of these things will be against the filter and so will all be trying to escape.</p>

<p>Continue to squeeze until you can do no more. Again, since it is horizontal, the final drips will collect at the rounded tip of the filter cap and be able to drip into the cup. If it was vertical, as for the initial part of the pressing, the liquid would be evenly distributed across the flat, circular base of filter cap and be unable to drip.</p>

<p>A quick flick into the cup catches the last remnants of the oily foam we're going to call <em>the crema</em>.</p>

3177,2,,2016-10-26T01:10:08.740,6,,"<p>Interesting question.
You are not alone when noticing flavor differences with different temperatures of coffee. When cupping coffee in a controlled lab situation for Quality Control purposes, I will often make multiple passes through the cups to taste the differences that are present as the coffee cools. Doing this tells me/us what we need to do while roasting to highlight/change the flavor profile of the roast.</p>

<p>The high acidity/brightness of a light roasted Kenya disappears as the cup cools. The darker roasted coffee that will show more ""sweetness"" at a high temp will show off more as it cools. These are but two examples. Other flavor characteristics that are found in roasted will definitely change as the coffee changes temp.</p>

<p>A lot of what you are tasting is perception. Here is a link to the key being how our taste buds translate it to our brain.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Food temperature affects taste, reveal scientists</a></p>

<p>Once the coffee is roasted the only thing you can do to change the flavor profile of your coffee at high temperatures is changing the brewing method. All the variables in brewing will without a doubt change the flavors that you perceive.
This will lead you to experimentation to find the flavors that you want to see.</p>

<p>If someone orders a coffee at a corner bakery and asks for a ""strong coffee"" they probably mean a high ground coffee to water ratio and a lot of dissolved caffeine. If someone complains in the same bakery about coffee that is too strong they probably mean that it is too bitter.</p>

<p>If a coffee professional is talking about coffee strength however, they are most likely referring to the total amount of dissolved solids (or TDS) which is measured with a refractometer. An espresso ranges somewhere in between 7% and 15% while a filter coffee is somewhere around 1,5%. That means an espresso is 93%-85% water and a filter 98,5%. The rest is what has been extracted from the coffee. Keep in mind that this is not to be confused with extraction. Higher extraction (bitter coffee) doesn't make a strong, but actually a ""weak"" coffee. Because you are running more water through the coffee the TDS will start to decrease at the point where the next ml of water is extracting less of the solids than the ml before. That means that in terms of flavor ""strong"" means often the opposite of what people would actually associate with a strong coffee. Holding the dosage constant, a strong espresso (too little water, thus something like a ristretto) would taste kind of sour, salty and unbalanced. A weak espresso (too much water) would taste bitter.
The point is, strength refers at first not to flavor but to the TDS which is determined by your coffee preparation and not by the roasting. The same coffee roasted darker is not stronger, it just received more heat.</p>

<p>Now, your package of coffee probably refers with it's ""three out of five strength"" to the roast grade (probably a medium to dark roast) which is just misleading marketing in my opinion.</p>

3185,2,,2016-11-01T12:47:14.533,1,,"<p>Go for Toddy if you want to do large batches. I suggest you experiment with the recipe a few times before you sell it to get the kind of cold brew you want and to get to know the coffee you are selling.</p>

<p>I like very strong cold brew, so my recipe would be 1:4 or 1:5 coffee to water (and I think this is roughly what Toddy suggests as well). Let it steep for about 6 to 12 hours, again depending on your taste. This gives you a concentrate that you can either dilute with water or I personally just pour a shot of it over a lot of ice and drink it like that. It gives a very sweet, full bodied cold brew. Most of the cold brew sold is way too diluted for my taste, I prefer the sirupy concentrate.</p>

<p>However you may not like it that way, so you could dilute the brew or experiment with the recipe. If the flavor is too intense try 1:6, then 1:8 and so on. I'd not go any lower than 1:10, although many people do. In the end it's a matter of taste and in your case how you want to sell it (diluted, on ice, in bottles etc.)</p>

<p>Also cold brew lasts a good week (arguably even 2 weeks) if you keep it refrigerated, so you can make several batches in advance with a toddy. If you start a week before selling you could make easily make around 15 liters (2 liters a night) or if you are ambitious even 30 liters (if you make another 2 liters during every day) of concentrate. If you sell it as shots (around 40ml) on ice, you can sell around 750 shots.</p>

3186,2,,2016-11-01T14:12:32.027,3,,"<p>The question is a very complex one, so I will try to answer with a standard approach of dialing in your espresso. Generally speaking what you should aim for is a espresso that is full bodied, sweet, fruity with crisp acidity, a syrupy mouth feel and an amazing aftertaste that stays with you long after you finished the cup. What you don't want to get are any sour (underextraction), bitter (overextraction), ashy flavors and a hollow aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.</p>

<p>You can get to that sweet spot different ways, using the single shot or double shot portafilter. There are some general guidelines though that you might want to follow.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Generally using a double shot porta filter delivers better results. You are more flexibel in adjusting the grind size for example. In basically all specialty coffee shops, double shot baskets are used for making espressos. Surely this has to do with efficiency as well, since you can make 2 shots at the same time. I would suggest you try to find the sweet spot with your combination number 4 (or number 1 if you really don't want any more than a single espresso).</p></li>
<li><p>The first thing you have to consider is your recipe. Using a double shot basket what you should aim for is a dose:yield ratio of around 1:2. That means if you start with 20g of coffee (in the double basket), aim for a 40ml yield (for a double espresso). A very common recipe would be to start with an 18g dose and aim for a 36g yield. That would be a double shot or two single shots. If you pull shorter you will get a ristretto (short espresso) and if you push through more water, it would be a lungo. The yield is not fixed, you may adjust it depending on the coffee and taste. It is just a basis for dialing in properly, a baseline.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you decided on a recipe you should lock in the dose. Changing the dose, changes everything else, so you want to keep it as consistent as possible. However the grams are not fixed and will change all the time. If you change the coffee type/brand/origin/roast etc. you will have to adjust again. Even variables such as temperature, humidity and how much coffee is in the basket above the grind chamber will influence your grinders behavior and therefore the dose. The only definitive remedy is weighing out every single dose and shot (for home use at least whenever you use new coffee to find a setup that delivers consistently good results with this brand or type, albeit it will not consistently be optimal).</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you have the dose and recipe fixed you want to get an extraction time of somewhere between 20 and 30 seconds. Adjust the grind size (keep in mind that your dose changes as well, when you adjust the size, since the grinder measures the time of grinding and not the weight of the coffee) so that you reach the desired extraction time with the given recipe. Don't overdo it though and stay in the espresso grind range.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep in mind that you tamp correctly. Level out the grounds before tamping with slight shaking, hitting the basket on the sides and using your fingers. Try to tamp as straight as possible, the distance between the basket and the edge of the tamper should be equal on all sides. A tilted puck will extract badly. You don't have to tamp terribly hard, just until you don't feel the coffee bed changing any more. Anything more is redundant.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull a shot, taste and reflect if the result is the coffee you want. If it is, good for you, most likely it isn't though and you will have to adjust again.</p></li>
<li><p>If it isn't the coffee you want, try to figure out what's wrong with it. Is it too sour? Probably underextracted. Try to grind slightly finer, so the extraction process takes a few seconds longer to get to the yield you want. Does it taste bitter and hollow? Probably overextraced, in this case do the opposite.</p></li>
<li><p>Forget everything of the above and follow your taste buds! If one or more of those things doesn't produce taste profiles that you like, just kind of ignore them and try something else.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a general approach of how to dial in your grinder and produce a nice shot. It is not the only one, it is definitely incomplete and it will not be able to replace experimenting and experience.</p>

<p>Also don't bother too much about the pressure at the beginning, try to get consistent results that you like when pulling shots and after a while you will learn and understand your machine better. Also don't forget to flush the group head and portafilter before use, so old coffee oils are removed and you get up to temperature.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

3193,2,,2016-11-04T10:14:41.123,3,,"<p>The digestive problems you've experienced may be due to the acidity of the coffee. Now lighter roasted coffee will definitely be more acidic so the roast level of the bean can be at play. Not only that, but underextraction can cause high levels of acidity also.</p>

<p>The only discernible difference I can garner from what you've told me is that in the Aeropress there is a slight form of full immersion brewing. This will better encourage all parts of the coffee to be well extracted and so reduce the acidity of the resulting cup.</p>

<p>If you're curious as to what the real cause is, buy two different batches of beans, one medium-dark roast and one light roast. Then perform Aeropress, French press, pourover, espresso and possibly drip extractions with both beans and note down your gastric reaction to each cup. If there is almost no significant difference between any of them to how it makes you feel i.e. it seems to occur at random, you might just be hyper-sensitive to small changes in acidity caused by the differences in the imperfections of each extraction.</p>

3195,2,,2016-11-04T18:41:17.023,7,,"<p>Without any more specific information about the coffee you use and what recipe you use for the french press, we won't be able to give you a specific answer with a solution to your problem. However too acidic probably means that your coffee is underextracted. That means the water hasn't had enough time or wasn't hot enough to extract the flavor compounds you want out of the ground coffee.</p>

<p>There are a few variables that will influence extraction with french press. I already mentioned time and heat. A recipe that I have used with very good results is 6g coffee per 100ml of water, ground to the size of coarse salt with a steep time of 4min. At first you only add a little water (just off the boil), twice to three times the weight of coffee grounds and let sit for 1min. Then give it a stir (there will be grounds on the top forming a crust), add the rest of the water and wait until 4min. Plunge and immediately transfer your coffee to a preheated vessel, either your mugs or a jug. Important here is that you don't let the coffee sit as it will continue to extract and taste bitter after a few minutes.</p>

<p>This should give you an even, full bodied extraction. If you feel like it's still too acidic, you could vary the variables involved. If you grind slightly finer the extraction will be higher. Same thing if you increase the brew time a bit. I suggest you just play around and keep in mind that these variables are not independent of each other. Finer grind means faster extraction for example. With a basic understanding of how extraction works you should get the hang of it quickly.</p>

<p>If the coffee still tastes too acidic although you have tried all suggestions check if the roast is too light, since light roasts tend to have more acidity. Also the origin of your coffee is a factor, african coffees (there are many different regions and processing methods so this is a big generalization) tend to be more acidic, while sumatran coffees are considered the least acidic. Central and South American coffees will often have acidity levels in the middle range.

This is also important regarding the biodiversity and pest rate present in the area. Generally, the more biodiversity and different kinds of shade trees, there will be less harmful pests and better chances of surviving extreme weather conditions (e.g. droughts or landslides). In the Americas, the coffee berry borer is currently the biggest problem, both from a biological and an economic perspective. Hence, it is not just the climate, but also the surrounding conditions that determine whether the coffee plants can grow. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the place I work we just use the Toddy. For big batches it is in my opinion the best alternative. We have a drip stand (Hario or some other fancy wooden thing) as well, but it's just not as good, because the water is dripping on the same spot of coffee grounds constantly. You can mitigate that by placing a round paper filter on the grounds (from Aeropress e.g.), however there will still be some uneven extraction. An alternative is the Filtron system, which is basically the same thing. What you could do as well is just brew it in big jars or barrels and then filter it in 3 levels with a restrainer, cheese cloth and coffee filters.
<a href=""https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/blog/cold-brewer-roundup/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is</a> a nice little comparison by Stumptown coffee, that places the Filtron and Toddy system on the top.</p></li>
<li><p>To be honest, cold brew works best with washed Ethiopian/Kenian light roasted coffees in my opinion, which really brings out a lot of sweetness and a nice floral flavor. Cold brew generally reduces acidity, so it works well with high acidity (african) coffees. Sumatran coffees, which would match your flavor requests, are already very low in acidity so the cold brew method can't really shine here. You can also try natural processed african coffees, they would be more full bodied, chocolaty and with notes of red berries (had an amazing ethiopian natural that tasted incredibly like strawberries). They are not really my thing though, a bit flavor overkill most of the times.
Central American coffees usually work quite well as well, with a bit more nutty, caramel and chocolaty flavors.</p></li>
<li><p>I've written something on this <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3064/what-are-good-methods-to-prepare-and-vend-cold-brew/3185#3185"">in this question</a> already. In any case I use very high coffee to water ratios and don't dilute the concentrate (just served on a lot if ice). However for many people that is too strong and they dilute it with water or even add a little milk, which works quite well with this kind of concentrate.</p></li>
<li><p>Depends on your taste and the best recommendation anyone can give you here is to try a lot of different coffees and recipes until you find your style. You should definitely do some testing before you sell, so you actually like what you are selling and understand what it is. Generally longer contact time means higher extraction, 12 to 14 hours is what I do at home (in a mason jar) and I like it most. In the shop we do faster brews though.</p></li>

3224,2,,2016-11-16T23:32:55.437,2,,"<p>First things first, the ingredients of the <strong><em>crema</em></strong> is partly the answer of this question.</p>

<p>The foam on top of any coffee beverage (espresso, Turkish, aeropress or any other) is formed simply the same. A lipid/water emulsion forms the outer sphere and some gas is inside this sphere. All these spheres stick to each other with tiny coffee bean fragments invisible to human eye. Let's focus to the gas. The gas is mostly Carbon dioxide that is produced during the Maillard reaction when the coffee beans are roasted.</p>

<p>Ok, now we know the chemistry behind. There are three (actually four, but water is there all the time) main contents for our recipe to produce crema:</p>

<ol>
<li>Lipids</li>
<li>Coffee bean fragments</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide</li>
</ol>

<p>Lipids and Carbon dioxide are formed by roasting. Fragments are the very very fine powders emerge as the side product of grinding. Fragments don't leave the ground coffee. Lipids, too. But, Carbon dioxide flies away in time.</p>

<p>Normally, after roasting the beans, it is better to wait for two to four days (based on many criteria just like bean type, roast level, brewing technique, etc.) for the Carbon dioxide level of the roasted beans to settle. Then, the flavor of those beans will be delicious. After that time, Carbon dioxide fades away and the roasted beans start to stale.</p>

<p>As you can reason, if your beans have less Carbon dioxide, your final cup of coffee would have less crema. If you have freshly roasted (e.g. 3-days old) coffee, your final cup of espresso would have a thick foam.</p>

<hr>

<p>It is also known that water pressure affects the crema volume, but should not affect as much as you mentioned here. Even at 7 bars, a decent crema forms according to <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12452670"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this study</a>.</p>

<p>And a note, if your machine has difficulties producing enough pressure, more tamping will probably results over-heated water flowing very slowly through the grounds, causing them to burn and all of the lipids to evaporate, could not form the spheres of the crema. As a result, you probably worsen the crema production, coffee odor fills the room but you cannot drink that flavor. Now, all you'll get is boiled coffee juice.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> The amount of crema is mostly correlated with the freshness of the coffee, not the pressure.</p>

We tried it, and I found it lost much of its character and became more noticeably bitter, but then again the blend we used for our cold press at Starbucks was too bright and astringent for my tastes to begin with. Your mileage may vary, and a fuller-bodied coffee with ""sweeter"" flavor notes like cocoa or berry might resist this tendency toward bitterness a bit better.   </p>

<p>The downside is that this requires a steam wand, which many people don't have at home. But it introduces less water into the coffee than simply adding hot water to cold press, and could give you more precise temperature control, so if you have the equipment, it couldn't hurt to try. </p>

<p>If you want to test it without investing in equipment, you could ask a local coffee shop that sells cold press if this is something they could make for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since caffeine works as a central nervous stimulant, it will cause the
  body to “forget” that it is tired. When used in moderation, caffeine
  can help to keep energy levels up during the day. The caveat is that
  tolerance is built quickly; to make up for adenosine receptors that
  have been inhibited by caffeine, the brain will create even more
  receptors. As a result, more caffeine is needed to keep drowsiness at
  bay.</p>
  
  <p>When the brain detects increased adenosine, it will make you feel even
  more tired than if you’d never picked up a cup of coffee at all. Now,
  you’ll need even more caffeine to keep energy levels up and help your
  brain to function at its best.</p>

<p>(2) Along the lines of Coffee Withdrawal in an earlier answer, coffee affects neurotransmitters like serotonin.

<p>Your body does not burn/feed off the caffeine, the caffeine causes your body to burn glycogen/glucose and fat.</p>

<p>So, naturally, once their effects wear off, and your body returns to it's normal state, the energy stores are going to be more depleted than they usually are, and your body will recognize that as feeling run-down afterwards.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The coffee to milk ratio is higher than for a cappuccino. I would use a double shot of espresso in the same cup you make a single shot cappuccino. Not ristrettos or anything like that, just a nice balanced espresso.</p></li>
<li><p>The steamed milk should be less stiff and more velvety/silky than for a cappuccino. So basically you want to aerate the milk less. Don't overheat the milk or the foam will get stiff, besides you are burning the milk and it will just make your flat white (or any other milk based coffee drink) taste bad and burnt. You can achieve this by just slightly lowering the milk pitcher until you hear the hissing sound. This is when you pull in air into the milk. Don't overdo it, just give it a few hisses and then submerge the nozzle back into the milk so it is rolling and mixing all the foam with the milk to make it silky and smooth. Turn of the steam when it is getting hot, check with the area of your palm underneath the thumb as it is usually more sensitive. If it's getting to hot there, stop the steam. Another sign is the sound of the steaming, when it is getting deeper it's probably done. The surface of the milk should appear smooth and glossy. Too many big bubbles probably means you lowered the pitcher too much and aerated too long. If there's still too much foam or you can see like a kind of solid blob of foam in the middle as you swirl it gently, just pour it out of the pitcher.</p></li>

<p>It's known that Gesha is an Arabica species and one of the Ethiopian varieties. Based on the story, this variety is moved to Panama by chance and grown there which enhances its flavor. However, right after this discovery, Ethiopia limits exports of coffee seeds.</p>

<p>(From this point on, I only make a guess.) This may lead limited number of enhanced trees outside Ethiopia. Therefore, the price may increase.</p>

3251,2,,2016-12-01T19:43:44.793,3,,"<p>As an economist I'd argue it's a mix of scarcity and good marketing. Actually it was first planted as a more resistent variety to leaf rust on one farm in Panama (Esmeralda). They took it from Ethiopia, so it must grow under different conditions (guessing it has to be above 1500m like all Arabica coffees). This actually implies that it might even be less complicated to grow than some other Arabica varieties, leading to the conclusion that it cannot be due to the difficulty of growing it.</p>

<p>The quality is definitely very good, since it was winning prices as ""the best of Panama"" since 2004. It also scores consistently above 90 (exceptional quality) in the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) score. However there are other coffees that score as high or higher and cost only half and less of the price. Thus I'd guess it's mainly a combination of little supply (because for a long time it was only grown on one farm) and telling a nice story about it, that made roasters want it. The taste certainly helps, but can in my opinion not totally explain the price differences.</p>

<p>I'd say this holds true in general. Supply and Demand plus marketing your product as something special determines the price. It's a form of market power to differentiate your product from similar products (substitutes), to make it stand out. Just look at Kopi Luwak espresso. It is arguably the most expensive espresso just because it has passed through civets digestive tracts and is then handpicked out of the fecal matter. The production process is quite demanding, which limits production quantity and gives it a good 'origin story'. Never mind that it tastes like what it actually is.</p>

3256,2,,2016-12-05T10:29:29.133,3,,"<p>Practically speaking, an arbitrary number can only get you so far. What you need to focus on is what we would call 'dialling in'. This is a term to describe the process by which we find the most suitable parameters for making the 'best' cup of coffee. 'Dialling in' can mean a multitude of things but in your case it will simply refer to finding the right grind size and/or dosage.</p>

<p>The problem you seem to have is directly because you are shooting far above and below the the 'right' grind size assuming that you are using the exact same mass of coffee every time.</p>

<p>To find the right grind size, you must have a decent enough grinder that grinds to a uniform level and can be adjusted to a high degree, you should only be adjusting in small amounts. If you do not have a grinder, it will be very hard if not impossible to find a pre-ground bag that works perfectly for you. If you are choking the machine because the particle size is too small, adjust coarser gradually and keep making shots to observe the change in extraction times and flavours. If you are extracting very fast and water is rushing out causing under-extraction, adjust finer. Repeat until you achieve the 'best' flavour you can.</p>

<p>At this point, if your coffee still tastes off then your problem may lie in your dosage. You may be using too much or too little coffee causing hindrance to a uniform extraction. Once again, simply adjusting your dosage above and below your current amount in small increments will help you find the spot where the extraction performs the best.</p>

<p>If your coffee still tastes off you may be having temperature stability issues, water quality issues, coffee freshness issues, unstable brew-head pressure issues, poor basket distribution and tamping or any combination of the above.</p>

<p>Since the 'right' grind size for espresso, or any brew method for that matter, is never the same and is dependent on, at the very least, the coffee bean itself which is still a variable even if brewing from the same bag, finding the 'right' grind size is always going to be a chase and 'dialling in' will be an exercise you will almost always have to do if you want the best coffee you can extract from what you have.</p>

<p><a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/3255/1702"">MT San's answer</a> provides a link to a more generic explanation and reference to the different general grind sizes for the different brew methods if you are completely in the dark.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coffee choice helps, but most important factors can be reduced to keeping the roast fresh and adding some robusta for more fun&amp;crema.</li>
<li>Quality water helps. Interestingly, crema amount, quality and retention can be reduced to similar variables as with beer (except there's more literature for beer on this topic) -- The more long, non-polar molecules dissolved in the water, the better. The more short polar molecules (e.g. minerals, salts, simple sugars), the less crema. Trace amounts of detergents are terrible for crema.</li>
<li>I use around 1 scoop of extra fine grind</li>
<li>brew non-inverted, with fine steel filter:

<ol>
<li><em>Tamper the grinds</em> down to a compact, uniform puck. As hard as possible. This helps: <a href=""http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1523667"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1523667</a></li>
<li>Add around 1 ""aeropress unit"" of water, boiling right from the kettle. <em>Pour the water slowly over a bent spoon</em>, so it doesn't impact the grounds with too much force, and the coffee puck stays intact&amp;holds together. Some people use extra paper filter on the grounds, but I wasn't able to see any significant difference (apart from the wasted filter). The spoon cools the boiling water down a bit, and I found no improvement in any further temperature adjustment.</li>
<li>Don't wait (there's no steeping) and press it down with all your might. Stop just before squeezing the grounds. Whole pressing should take ~20sec. Always apply maximum force -- if the pressing goes too fast, use finer grind or more coffee (instead of less force) to make it slower; If it's too slow or stuck, use coarser grind.</li>

<p><em>My coffee - for some reason - has a dragon curve floating on its surface!</em> </p>

<p><em>Technical details:</em> I'm using a fine - but thin - paper filter in my Aeropress and some blent of mostly Arabica coffee for my beans of a medium grind size. It seems most likely to me that the dragon curve I observe is made of lipids - especially since Arabica (according to a quick internet search) seems to contain a decent amount (~15%). That, however, doesn't explain its fractal appearance. I've seen lipids floating on coffee many times before, but as far as I can remember, they just formed boring puddles or were entirely absent (maybe due to using a thicker filter). </p>

<p>I welcome any attempt, preferably backed by published research, to explain this distracting phenomenon as well as pictures of similar curves formed by lipids on liquid surfaces (preferably coffee).</p>

<p>Brownian motion is best explained by statistical physics. Small atoms or molecules collide each other continuously in very high speeds in the liquids even if they seem serene. However, as the total effect (average) of these collisions are quite stable, we see a still surface.</p>

<p>The small particles, which are very light in mass, can be affected by these collisions. So, they may move with respect to these collisions.

3267,2,,2016-12-12T12:09:33.333,-1,,"<p>Perfect Pour over coffee? Most people mistakenly think that the key to coffee flavor is grinding your own beans. I am not sure how this thought populated people's heads but many other folks tend to re-enforce this notion, which somehow keeps perpetuating this false notion.  Coffee flavor comes from the oils in the coffee beans, and like all oil, coffee bean oil also goes rancid, and at rate much faster than many people realize. If coffee beans are not stored in a vacuum, air will turn coffee rancid after about five days, and actually you can begin to both taste and smell the difference three days after it is roasted. This is true (Listen up!) whether or not the coffee is ground or not.  Coffee is at it's peak flavor and at its most complex between 18 to 24 hours after it is roasted, and much of the CO2 has been given off. After three days, it starts to flatten out, and at five days, it has lost a good deal of unique flovors.   </p>

<p>You can do an experiment if you like, by simply smelling the roasted beans after 18 hours, and comparing it to the smell of the beans at five days. Try also scooping up a handful of the same beans and smelling the same newly roasted coffee to the (same variety) of beans that were roasted ten days earlier but stored in the open air.  You will be amazed at how rancid the coffee smells. Unless you have experienced this test with your own nose, it will hard for you to understand why some higher end coffee shops have the ability to brew coffee with intense and complex delicate flavors. There is little mystery here. Your 5-10 day old roast may be freshly ground, but the grounds that result from that effort, are long past their prime. </p>

<p>Storing your coffee in the jar in your Fridge or in your freezer won't really preserve your coffee's freshness. You need to keep it in a vacuum (no air please).  You can order a container that comes with a hand pump, and pump out the oxygen.  Simply place he lid on the container, but the rubber stop on (similar to the one used on wine bottles, and using the hand pump, pump out the air.  This will extend the life of your freshly roasted coffee well past the five day maximum, and keep it close to the freshness that it had at day one.  </p>

<p>For years, I failed to understand that water temperature was also important. Having the water too hot or not hot enough will spoil your result.  No reason to guess any longer. There are number of pour over kettles that either come with a gauge or can be outfitted with one. I used to boil the water and then estimate how long to wait before pouring. That is not a recipe for success. Buy the bloody gauge! It's important, and that way, you can learn for yourself how temperature affects flavor. </p>

<p>Use a quality paper filter if you don't have a gold filter. Note that the gold filter has to fit the shape of the metal or ceramic holder it goes into perfectly. Otherwise the flow rate is most often going to be incorrect. One of the most famous brands of filters no longer makes a gold insert that fits their famous long standing ceramic cone holder. Corporate blunder. Too bad.  You might find one third party. </p>

<p>I think I can taste the fact that bleached paper has somewhat less of a paper taste, but I do wet the paper before hand pouring hot water through it.  I also do the same if I am using a natural non-bleached paper or bamboo paper. There does seem to be less paper taste if I do. If you want to taste all of the complex additional flavors that come with fresh beans, you might also find that wetting the paper before putting the grounds in, and actually pouring some water through first does help. Why not experiment?</p>

<p>How long to let the coffee bloom before slowly pouring the rest your water through the grounds.  Why not experiment with each variety of bean. The fineness of the grind is a factor to how long you should increase or decrease the bloom time. Generally speaking the courser your grind, the more time you will need to let it bloom. This is really the domain of experiementation. I don't increase the grind to get the shortest bloom time. I know some coffee shops do that. But I suggest experimentation. One to two minutes of bloom depending on your grind. But experiment, please. </p>

<p>The bottom line is the freshness of your bean. Good coffee roasters cost a lot of money. Air roasters start at about $200 these days, and good drum roaster that roasts 1/2 pound to 2 pounds can cost as much as $1500.  That's a lot of money folks Does it make a huge difference in the flavor. Yes it does. It makes a huge difference to have fresh beans. In fact, it makes THE MOST difference provided you can store what you don't use that first day in a proper container.  You can get your brew method completely right, but if your coffee is not fresh, it may be smooth tasting but it will always be missing the unique and complex flavor it could otherwise have. In short, smooth but flat as a pancake no matter what your technique, water temperature, or equipment. </p>

3269,2,,2016-12-13T11:25:58.453,2,,"<p>There are many, many, many types. In order to give a good overview, some background knowledge is useful. What all types of coffee have in common is that all are produced from the pits of coffee cherries, the fruits borne by trees in the genus coffea (coffee beans are technically seeds of these trees, not beans). Coffee cherries are harvested from coffee trees, the pits are removed and processed, producing green coffee beans. These are then roasted, ground, and brewed. </p>

<p>Coffee can vary on any of the following factors:</p>

<p><strong>Bean Variety -</strong> There are two major bean varieties of coffee: arabica and robusta. Arabica coffees are more ubiquitous and generally regarded as superior in quality to robusta coffees. If you are buying coffee from a coffee shop, ordering it at a restaurant, or brewing it at home, there is a very good chance you are drinking an arabica variety. Robusta is easier to grow and a less temperamental crop than arabica, contains quite a bit more caffeine, and generally is poorer quality than arabica. Robusta varieties are often used in instant coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Processing Method -</strong> There are two major processing types for green coffee beans: washed and unwashed. Washed coffees remove the cherry before the bean is left to dry, while unwashed coffees have their beans removed from the cherries after drying. Unwashed coffees often come from Africa and Indonesia and have richer, earthier flavors, while washed coffees often come from Latin America, and are smoother and fruitier.</p>

<p><strong>Geographic Origin -</strong> One of the most important factors, as coffee flavors vary greatly with geography, climate, and soil composition. For example, Ethopian coffees tend to be rich, full-bodied, and wine-like, Hawaiian coffees like Kona tend to be more acidic (flavor term, not pH), and Latin American coffees tend to be more medium bodied, fruity, and floral.
Roast - Roasting is a complex process that can produce varying degrees of flavor and caffeine content. Roasts levels can include light/half-city, medium/full-city, full (Viennese/Italian), and double (French), in order of increasing boldness. Contrary to popular opinion, lighter roasts tend to have more caffeine than darker roasts. A good illustration of the process can be found here: <a href=""http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.sweetmarias.com/roast</a>...</p>

<p><strong>Brewing method -</strong> Can include drip filter, french press, percolated, espresso, or other methods. Brewing method also makes a big difference, with coffee aficionados generally preferring french press and espresso.</p>

<p>The most expensive type of coffee is Kopi Luwak from Sumatra, Bali, Java, and Sulawesi. Kopi Luwak roughly translates to ""civet coffee"" in English, and is called such because the beans are harvested from the droppings of civets (a cat-like mammal from Indonesia). The beans are supposedly of superior quality because the civets choose only the ripest coffee beans to eat from coffee trees, and are processed in a unique way by the civets digestive tract. Kopi Luwak often sells for around $300/lb.</p>

<p>The following are the different types of coffee drinks that you may find in a cafe that prepares coffee using the espresso coffee making method:</p>

<p><strong>Affogato-</strong> This is a term that literally means 'drowned'. It is the description of a shot of separately served espresso that is later poured over a the top of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or gelato. This beverage is usually served in a short drink glass and is a Italian desert favourite. Popular Affogatos include Vanilla Affogato, Mocha Affogato, and Peppermint Affogato.</p>

<p><strong>Americano-</strong> Also known as ""Lungo"" or ""Long Black"" and made by diluting 1-2 shots of espresso with hot water in order to approximate the texture, flavor and body of an American-style drip coffee. Said to have been originally devised as a sort of insult to Americans who wanted their Italian espresso diluted.</p>

<p><strong>Babycino-</strong> A cappuccino styled drink served in an up-market café typically for children. It consists of warm milk in a small cup and topped with milk froth and chocolate powder. No espresso coffee essence is added.
Breve: A term in Italian that means short and is used to describe an espresso coffee drink made with a half-and-half light cream or semi-skim milk instead of full fat milk</p>

<p><strong>Caffe' Freddo-</strong> Chilled, sweetened espresso served in a tall glass, often on ice.</p>

<p><strong>Caffe Latte or “Latte”-</strong> A ‘premium milk coffee experience’. Freshly steamed milk without foam served in a tall glass with a shot of espresso coffee.
Caffe Mocha: A combination of chocolate syrup and a shot of espresso, topped with steamed milk and a layer of micro-foam. Finished with a sprinkled of chocolate.</p>

<p><strong>Cappuccino Chiaro-</strong> (AKA Wet or Light cappuccino): Cappuccino prepared with more milk than usual.</p>

<p><strong>Cappuccino Scuro-</strong> (AKA Dry or Dark cappuccino) Cappuccino prepared with less milk than usual.</p>

<p><strong>Cappuccino: “Cap”-</strong>  A ‘traditional morning heart starter’. Steamed foamed velvety milk poured over one shot (1) of coffee oil extract made from 12gm of freshly ground beans producing 38ml of essence. Finished by topping with foam and a sprinkle of chocolate powder. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup.</p>

<p><strong>Con panna-</strong> Like the beverage ""macchiato"", but whipped cream is substituted for steamed milk.</p>

<p><strong>Cortado-</strong> means ""cut"" in Spanish so the double shot espresso served in a demetesse glass supported with a metal handle is ""cut"" with an equal part of hot milk, making it in between the size and strength of a macchiato and a cappuccino. It is popular in Spain and Portugal, as well as throughout Latin America and Cuba, where it is drunk in the afternoon. Variations include more froth on top than a traditional cortado and occasionally with different names such as Piccolo or Gibraltar. Thanks to Ryan Cerbus for the entry.</p>

<p><strong>Corretto-</strong> Espresso ""corrected"" with a touch of grappa, cognac, sambuca, or other spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Doppio-</strong> Italian term for double. Double Espresso or twice the amount of coffee and twice the amount of water. Basically it describes two shots of espresso in one demitasse container.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso con Panna-</strong> A variation of the macchiato by substituting a dollop of whipped cream for the milk froth. Basically a Starbucks invention. Means in Italian ""espresso with cream”.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso Lungo-</strong> American term where a shot is extracted longer for a bit of extra espresso. Tends to maximizes the caffeine but will mostly produce a more bitter cup.</p>

<p><strong>Espresso Romano-</strong> Espresso served with a lemon peel on the side. Whilst not a typical accompaniment in Italy it is commonly served with the espresso beverage in America.</p>

<p><strong>Flat White-</strong> “White Coffee” - ‘uncompromising taste’.Steamed microfroam milk poured through and under the espresso crème produced from one shot (1) of coffee extract made on 12gm of freshly ground coffee producing 38ml of essence. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup. A common espresso coffee order in Australia/New Zealand. Great for latte art!</p>

<p><strong>Hammerhead-</strong> A coffee drink only served in the USA. It is an American term for a shot of espresso in a coffee cup that is topped up with drip-filtered coffee. As Kris Rosvold explains in the comments: In Oregon, the hammerhead is usually known as a red eye and uses 2 shots of espresso topped up in a 16oz travel mug with drip coffee. It's also sometimes called a ""shot in the dark"".</p>

<p><strong>Irish Coffee-</strong> Coffee mixed with a dash of Irish whiskey and served with cream on top.</p>

<p><strong>Latte Macchiato-</strong> Steamed milk served in a tall glass rather than a cup that is “stained” by a shot of espresso coffee.</p>

<p><strong>Long Black-</strong> Often called the “American”. It is the ‘benchmark coffee without milk’. It is pure coffee made from one &amp; one half shots of coffee extract made on 16gm of fresh ground beans producing 50ml of essence blended with steamed water. Served in a pre heated vitrified ceramic cup with the essence floated over the top of a cup filled with hot/boiling water. It is a standard espresso (Short Black) but lengthened by the addition of hot/boiling water.</p>

<p><strong>Lungo-</strong> An espresso made by purposely allowing more water to flow through the ground coffee than usual. (sometimes called an Americano or ‘long’).</p>

<p><strong>Macchiato-</strong> Meaning “stained” - Described as ‘strong, marked or stained’. A touch of steamed foamed milk added to a double shot of coffee extract made from 24gm of fresh ground beans producing 75ml of essence. Served in glass.</p>

<ul>
<li>moisture and airborne aromas</li>
<li>oxygen</li>
<li>heat</li>
</ul>

<p>In the roasting process the coffee bean doubles in size and gives off most of its moisture content. After roasting the coffee bean becomes super hygroscopic. (i.e. it wants to absorb all the moistures and airborne aromas in the atmosphere that surround it). Oxygen reacts with the delicate coffee oils and turns them rancid, and heat brings the coffee oils to the surface where the oxygen can easily attack it.</p>

<p>So a completely air-tight container that has not been used to store any other products is a great start. Non porous ceramic or glass is preferred. Make sure light can't penetrate,and it's kept in a cool place away from any heat source. Don't grind it until you plan to use it. While roasted coffee bean quality can be maintained for a few weeks without loss if handled properly, ground coffee can loose significant value within 24 hours. I am no fan of the fridge/freezer option.</p>

3272,2,,2016-12-13T12:36:21.633,3,,"<p>In the global market for coffee beans, Arabica coffee beans make up about 60% of the market, Robusta about 35% and 5% is made up of other coffee beans like Liberica. Both coffee beans belong to the botanic Genus of Coffea and the Sub-Genus of Eucoffea, with Arabica being the commercial/trade name for Coffea Arabica and Robusta being the commercial/trade name for Coffea canephora. World coffee trade: arabica and robusta.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Krwuf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Krwuf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Arabica coffee beans differ from Robusta coffee beans on so many levels. Here are the ones that I know about:</p>

<p><strong>Growing conditions:</strong> Arabica coffee is shade grown in the cooler mountains above 1,000 meters and up to 2,500 meters, while Robusta is typically cultivated at lower altitudes in warmer climates. Robusta is also more disease and pest-resistant than Arabica.</p>

<p><strong>Country of origin:</strong> Arabica coffee bean is produced primarily by Brazil, Columbia and Ethiopia, while Robusta is produced by Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia.
Un-roasted bean colour (above): In its un-roasted form, Arabica will be a darker shade of green, where Robusta tends to be more straw coloured.</p>

<p><strong>Caffeine content:</strong> Caffeine content in Arabica ranges from 0.85 to 1.4%, while the caffeine content in Robusta ranges from 1.7% to 4.0%. So on average, Robusta has more than twice the caffeine content of Robusta.</p>

<p><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Arabica has about 60% more lipids (fatty acids) than Robusta which plays a part in promoting Arabica’s overall superior cup.</p>

<p><strong>Visually:</strong> Arabica is elongated in shape while Robusta is round. Arabica is large in size while Robusta is small (half the size). Arabica is a flatter dome while Robusta is more like a bubble dome. Arabica has a variant underside crease while Robusta has a generally straight crease.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Arabica is typically traded at twice the price of Robusta due to Arabica’s lower plant yield, high labour intensity in farming and increased costs associated with crops grown at higher and on more difficult terrains.</p>

<p><strong>Commerce:</strong> Arabica is the coffee bean that is purchased by cafes, while Robusta is the coffee bean that is typically used to make instant coffee, although the better grades of Robusta may be blended with Arabica in some cafe offers. The case for the humble Robusta coffee bean.</p>

<p><strong>Taste:</strong> Arabica produces a sweet-soft, mild and aromatic taste, with a smooth rich full-bodied pallet, while Robusta beans yield a harsher, bitter tasting cup often described as grain-like, oatmeal and woody. Where Arabica can produce a variety of taste notes including fruity, chocolaty and nutty, Robusta is just Robusta.</p>

<p><strong>There are some ways to visually differentiate between the Arabica and Robusta coffee bean</strong></p>

<p>As a rule, in the roasted form:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arabica is oval in shape while Robusta is round</li>
<li>Arabica is large in size while Robusta is small (half the size)</li>
<li>Arabica is a flatter dome while Robusta is more like a bubble dome.</li>
<li>Arabica has a variant underside crease while Robusta has a generally straight crease.</li>

3278,2,,2016-12-18T06:26:07.683,2,,"<p>I tried ""bulletproof coffee"" recipe using a different brand of organic coffee and mixed in butter and coconut oil (instead of MTC oil). The coffee tasted creamy with a buttery/oily after taste. You can taste both the coconut and butter. If you're used to drinking strong coffee with cream this is not that much of a stretch. The effect of the caffeine in the coffee does last longer. </p>

<p><strong>Now let's talk about the effect</strong></p>

<p>Bulletproof coffee or butter coffee was derived from the traditional <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_tea"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Butter tea</a> used in the Tibet and the Himalayas. In the region a higher caloric density Yak butter is used. </p>

<p>MCT oil, which is also present in sufficient amounts in coconut oil (coconut oil also has higher amounts to HDL cholesterol to negligible LDL cholesterol, which is good) is an addition in tweaking the traditional butter tea to achive a Cognitive Enhancement. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_lipoprotein"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LDL</a> is essential to repair and maintain the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Myelin</a> sheath of neurons as such to good neural activity of the brain, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium-chain_triglyceride"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MCT</a> oil do not require energy for absorption, utilization, or storage. This means that MCT is generally considered a good biologically inert source of energy that the human body finds reasonably easy to metabolize. So in other words it provides a great energy boost with almost no fat storage. As such coconut oil constituting both, also metabolises into ketone bodies more efficiently than any other dietary substance, (Ketones may improve cognitive functioning) gives you a mental boot. MCT <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123336"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">have been tested to improve cognitive functioning</a>. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5166216"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MCTs also produce more ketones</a> per unit of energy than normal dietary fats. (Note: higher <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ketonema</a> is achieved with low Carb intake, following through can give body a non starvation ketosis effect)</p>

<p>Other effects of butter coffee is that it helps your body regulate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_resistance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Insulin resistance</a> blood sugar levels and the hormone <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leptin</a> (hormone responsible for body fat regulation, metabolism, breaking down fact for energy rather than storing).  Which in turn also has a cascading effect on your hunger signaling hormone <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghrelin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ghrelin</a>, without the hormone being secreted you will feel full for a long time (granted you did not take carbohydrate of any sort with the coffee, this is important as carbohydrates will trigger the fats to be stored in your body rather than broken down for energy, and later on will trigger ghrelin after the crabs run out).</p>

<p>But will it help you lose weight? Personally I felt, Uh, no!!!  Drinking coffee (in general) is liable to give you more energy, which may help motivate you to be more active, but only assuming you don't already drink a lot of caffiene.  Otherwise, all you're doing is offsetting the withdrawal symptoms. </p>

I think the best way would be to empty the Hopper and then fill it with the new beans (also sometimes you might want to switch up the espresso?). You should figure out how your grinder behaves once it's getting more empty and with this knowledge you can quite easily adjust the extraction such that the quality will not decrease too much.</p>

<p>The most likely case is that the dose will decrease slightly. You could put a scale next to the hopper and if you feel like your espresso is running faster, check if the dose changed because the hopper is getting empty and adjust your grinder accordingly. I think checking the dose and grind occasionally throughout the day is a good way to up your espresso game in any case. It helps me learn a lot about the coffee and setup. There's tons of variables, like humidity and temperature that will change the behavior of the grinder.</p>

<li>time</li>
<li>tamping</li>

I think that depending on the time you let the grounds steep and how hard you press the aero press you will get different results on caffeine strength.

<p>I just didn't enjoy the taste of the coffee pressed through those paper filters, and even if it could be improved somewhat by letting the coffee sit in the Aeropress for 40-60 seconds before pressing it out, I still couldn't see myself continuing to use it if that was all it was going to give me in terms of taste. Then I bought the ""fine"" version of the Able Brewing disk filter and that's when the taste finally matched my expectations - I really need those oils and those fine grounds in there, I don't think I can do without them in a hot-brew (after all, professional espresso has all that too).</p>

<p>I completely switched away from my French press since getting that filter and now I use the Aeropress both for my weekend hot-brews and as a strainer for the cold-brew I sometimes make in larger quantities to take with me to work (pressing the coffee through works much faster than pouring it in a regular strainer and waiting for gravity to do the work).</p>

<p>The only thing that didn't turn out exactly as I had imagined with this ""fine"" disk with the smaller holes is that I can't seem to ever clean it properly to where I can see light through most of the holes - for me most of the holes stay visibly plugged even after washing by pressing the disk with a sponge repeatedly on both sides and even after letting it sit in water with a bit of vinegar and then washing. But it hasn't prevented me from using it again, so I just shrugged that off and kept going. (Minus the vinegar because I don't want to wear out the already thin metal over time.) The most that's doing I think is requiring a bit more force to operate and giving me more of a workout.</p>

3317,2,,2017-01-11T09:42:42.533,2,,"<p>The math is fairly simple. You know for how much concentrated cold brew you will be using that it is at a ratio of 1:4. Since the resulting concentration of the cold brew is constant (since it has already been brewed) we only really care about the parts of water that are in it; 4 parts.</p>

<p>Therefore to calculate how much water you need to add to dilute your 1:4 concentrate into a 1:15 cup, divide the amount of concentrate you are using by 4 and then multiply that by the remaining parts you wish to add, which is <code>15 - 4 = 11</code> which gives you the amount of water you need to add in whatever units you measured the amount of concentrate you started with.</p>

<p>Using your example numbers:</p>

<p>Start with 100g of cold brew concentrate at 1:4 ratio. Each part of water is therefore <code>100/4 = 25g</code>. The amount of water you will need to add is therefore <code>11 x 25g = 275g</code> to result in a total amount of 375g in your final cup.</p>

<p>Check the final answer by doing a reverse calculation. If the concentrate is 1:4 and you have 100g of it, it means you started with 25g of ground coffee. Therefore making a 1:15 ratio cup of coffee with 25g of coffee means <code>25g x 15 = 375g</code> of water must be added.</p>

<p>The least expensive, most reliable starter method is to buy a hot air (fluidized bed) roaster specifically designed for roasting coffee.  I have a Fresh Roast SR500 that has served me well for a couple of years.  I've gotten to the point to where I am able to produce consistently excellent coffee at exactly the roast level I want.  Even with a dedicated coffee roaster it took me a couple of months to trial-and-error my way to anything drinkable.  Reading a couple of online home roasting forums has helped immensely but trying any of that without a proper roaster would have been a waste of time.  I've added a digital thermometer to my setup so I can actually see what's going on temperature wise in the roasting chamber, but other than that it just the stock setup.  Total cost is less than $200 and that's gotten me two years worth of great coffee.</p>

<p>If you decide it's not for you, you wouldn't have too much trouble selling it online for not too much less than your purchase price.  On the other hand, if you turn out to get hooked on home roasting, like me, you'll wish the thing would hurry up and die so you can go out and spend a lot more for a serious drum roaster.  :-))</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of percolators. However, l can add a few objective things on percolators.</p>

<p>Actually, you should understand how it brews as a first step. The water in the container boils, gets through ground coffee, drips over the container again. Therefore, you can fine tune brew time. You may brew for a short time for mild coffee or brew longer periods for intense cups. There are nice schemas of how it works in <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_percolator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The final cup is generally dull as most of the volatile flavor has been vaporized during process.</li>
<li>As aromatics are vaporized, it smells nice.</li>
<li>Most people brew longer with their percolator as they like the strong coffee taste in the morning.</li>
<li>You may have a burnt taste out of your coffee by over brewing if you are not careful.</li>

Said the other way, brewing with a higher ratio of coffee :: water, then diluting, is my preferred way of brewing, storing, and consuming.</p>

<p>That said, do store in a neutral vessel that is easy to clean (my preference is a wide-mouth glass jar). Stored in the fridge, it will last several days (maybe a week) and still taste okay. In a plastic jug (or so) it might 1- start to obtain bad tastes from the container, and 2- infect the jug with stale coffee taste over time.

However, the differences you describe may be a symptom of the fact that there are big differences between instant coffee and your pour-over.</p>

<p>Actual coffee. Your pour-over must be done with coffee grounds and so you are producing a cup of coffee freshly extracted from the grounds and subsequently freshly enjoyed. Not to mention the quality of the beans used might simply be of a higher quality than that used in instant coffee manufacturing. </p>

<p>Pour-over. The brewing method itself is often known to produce much more nuanced flavours as it allows the brewer control of water flow as opposed to other automated brewers. This means that you can better extract the sugars and compounds that give coffee its aroma and flavour. Instant coffee is not fresh and the general manufacturing process is done en masse so the level of control that you would have to fine tune your cup of pour-over coffee will simply not be present in instant coffee. Also, due to the extra processes involved in freeze-drying and packaging the instant coffee, many flavourful compounds can be lost well before it reaches your cup.</p>

<p>The factors noted above can change the resulting cup you enjoy and therefore change the amount of milk or sugar you will need in order for you to achieve your desired taste. Since the pour-over method can extract more sugars and delicate compounds that make coffee so delicious, it will also reduce the requirement of extra sugar.</p>

<li>The instant coffee, unless it's Starbucks or some other name brand, will most likely be made of <em>Robusta</em> varietal beans, which are widely known to taste far worse than the <em>Arabica</em> beans you will find used for pourovers.

<li>Instant coffee is essentially coffee concentrate. Remember how concentrated orange juice tastes.</li>

With that I'll add that for me I didn't appreciate the disk filter until I had the other components of my brew dialed in.  Again as Don Joe suggested, it may not be a one or the other decision. The disk filter will likely be good for some or even many coffees, but paper works for others. For me I'm glad to have rediscovered my disk filter. It's working well with this particular coffee. Looking forward to experimenting with others.</p>

3357,2,,2017-01-29T15:44:51.080,4,,"<p>Well first we should probably establish how cold the water is once it hits the ground. I imagine it is heated to almost boiling temperature in the Nespresso machine, however when it comes out and hits the cold cup it cools down almost immediately to probably 85 to 90°C or something around that.</p>

<p>In general colder water means basically that you are extracting less solid compounds of the coffee at a slower rate. So it is impossible really to draw any specific conclusions without knowing how hot the water is and how long the extraction takes.</p>

<p>However there are some general rules that always apply as the aforementioned slower extraction at lower temperatures. Another one is that with increasing contact time the extraction will be higher.</p>

<p>In terms of flavor lower extractions are generally associated with more acidic/sour coffee and the higher the extraction the more of the bitter compounds will be in your cup. An ideal extraction will be balanced with some fruity acidity and some darker, chocolaty flavors. Since you are using a full immersion technique it will not make that much of a difference though. I imagine you wait a few minutes before you start drinking the coffee? So there's probably a short moment where the extraction is balanced but the longer you sip on your cup the more bitter it gets which means overextraction. I think time is the more relevant variable in your case (if my estimate of the temperature is more or less correct)</p>

<p>Health wise I don't think it will make much of a difference either for the above mentioned reasons. Most of the caffein is extracted early on and by the end the extraction will be relatively high, regardless of the somewhat lower initial temperature. And since you are doing full immersion you will additionally always ingest a good amount of coffee grounds anyways.</p>

<p>I can think of one thing which would be quite hacky and might build up too much pressure in your stove top coffee maker. It is something I would try but would not recommend to anyone else. I have seen moka pots that weren't closed properly and almost exploded or that lacked the mesh filter inside and just kind of clocked up and then erupted a big fountain of hot coffee like a volcano. It's not pretty and rather dangerous. However I would put an aeropress like round paper filter (or any other thin paper/cloth filter cut into the right shape) inside on your coffee grounds or under the mesh filter. That would keep out the fines, but might lead to said increase of pressure (a Bialetti stove top has a pressure valve for security reasons, I've never seen it do it's job though). There's no guaranty that this would work or that no one gets hurt though, so I'm not suggesting you do it.</p>

Obviously JavaScript has almost nothing to do with coffee, but the author maintained a coffee barista metaphor throughout the book and stated that allongé is some coffee variant. So for the uninitiated coffee drinkers out there among his readers, can you explain what an allongé is, what makes it unique, and how to actually pronounce it? </p>

Here is the quoted text from Braithwaite's preface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Café Allongé, also called Espresso Lungo, is a drink midway between
  an Espresso and Americano in strength. There are two different ways to
  make it. The first, and the one I prefer, is to add a small amount of
  hot water to a double or quadruple Espresso Ristretto. Like adding a
  splash of water to whiskey, the small dilution releases more of the
  complex flavours in the mouth.</p>
  
  <p>“The second way is to pull an extra long double shot of Espresso. This
  achieves approximately the same ratio of oils to water as the dilution
  method, but also releases a different mix of flavours due to the
  longer extraction. Some complain that the long pull is more bitter and
  detracts from the best character of the coffee, others feel it
  releases even more complexity.</p>
  
  <p>“The important thing is that neither method of preparation should use
  so much water as to result in a sickly, pale ghost of Espresso.
  Moderation in all things.”</p>

If you are using them as vessel-recipients of water from an automated dripper, it will not produce the kind of cup you desire due to the randomness at which it applies water over the bed of coffee.</p>

<p>If you <em>are</em> doing pour-over, there are a few major parameters that you will have to control to produce clean cups. Note that you will require a gooseneck kettle in order to have proper control over the water flow.</p>

<p>Grind. Ensure that you are using a burr grinder that is of decent quality, meaning that it can grind to a good consistency with a low number of fines. Fines are smaller granules of coffee produced in the grinding process as the beans are crushed and can over-extract to bring out bitter flavours. Your grind size should also be of <a href=""https://kuissential.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/04-Intro2B.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">medium</a> level.</p>

<p>Water Temperature. This is one of the most important factors of the bunch for pour-over brewing in my experience. It's the parameter that you will change to fine tune how many compounds are being dissolved as you brew once you have a grind size that is in the right ball park. You should experiment with this as it will depend on the grind size and dose you use but I like to keep it at around 90 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Agitation. This measures how much you move and disturb the coffee. The more you agitate it by pouring, the more you continuously expose the coffee grounds to the water and encourage extraction. Controlling this will be another experimental variable for your specific parameters.</p>

<p>Aside from the above three that I believe to be the most important factors in what makes a clean pour-over brew, you should also take into account, the brew time, coffee-to-water ratio, coffee dose and obviously coffee origin and freshness.</p>

3376,2,,2017-02-03T22:44:04.970,1,,"<p>First I think we really need to establish what exactly you mean with murky, unclean, earthy and bright cup and flavor. These are all quite different things and while unclean, earthy and murky are definitely not things you want in your coffee, brightness is usually a desirable attribute.</p>

<p>A clean cup of of coffee is characterized by the absence of unwanted flavors, that often result from defects in the beans (which would correspond to your earthy description). A lot of people though incorrectly use it to describe the absence of fines in your cup (which would be the murky part). So in this sense a cleaner cup than what you get with a Chemex is almost impossible. Thus I guess you are actually talking about earthy flavors, which are in fact defects. Those flavors you will most likely not get out of your coffee, since they arise not due to a wrong extraction. Your extraction might be perfect, but because of defective beans it will still taste earthy. These flavors are common in badly processed coffees (dried on actual dirt or mold during the drying process for example). However a balanced extraction might minimize the presence of these flavors in the profile, since other flavors might be more dominant.</p>

<p>Brightness is as I've said usually a desirable attribute in coffee, it refers to a nice, fresh flavor and acidity. So I'm not quite sure what you mean with it, maybe you could clarify on that point.</p>

<p>If you indeed talk about acidity then I guess your coffee could be underextracted (more info on how you extract would be helpful as well) or the roast is underdeveloped. Underdevelopment could also bring some grassy, herbal like flavors in your coffee that might be mistaken for earthy flavors.</p>

<p>I guess any coffee you are brewing is from vapor that has condensed in the upper vessel instead of escaping.</p>

<p>Some pots are designed to only brew above some pressure. For example they might have a pressure valve which is like a hole with a spring that keeps a cap pressed until the pressure is reached.</p>

<p>In this case we see a spring, but it looks it is just intended to facilitate the funnel extraction.</p>

<p>Also such valve would operate in the opposite direction: At the pressure threshold it would close instead of opening.</p>

<p>P.D. The OP noted he found images through google where such hole could be found. I found <a href=""http://www.ebay.de/itm/DEFEKT-Cloer-5928-Espresso-Kocher-/331539918656"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.ebay.de/itm/DEFEKT-Cloer-5928-Espresso-Kocher-/331539918656</a> but it is a bit unclear if such item is defective as well (disclaimer at description).

3391,2,,2017-02-07T02:26:14.237,1,,"<p>This is my first answer, and I'm sharing my own personal method for making concentrate. Hope this helps!</p>

<p><strong>First: Source your coffee!</strong></p>

<p>My preference is very fresh, bright, fruity blends direct from a roaster or coffee house; a reputable barista <em>will</em> have a suggestion of which one makes a good cold brew. I strongly advise against cold brewing grocery store coffee as the resulting flavor will not be worth the effort, even when buying the more expensive, grind-it-yourself coffee. It's not fresh enough!</p>

<p>The grind should be slightly coarser than what would be used for a regular drip coffee maker and generally your barista will gladly grind for you.</p>

<p><strong>Most important:</strong></p>

<p>Use a 1:1 ratio, ounces coffee :: cups water</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1 ounce coffee : 1 cup water</li>
<li>4 ounces coffee : 4 cups / 1 quart water</li>
<li>12 ounces coffee : 12 cups / 3 quarts of water*</li>
<li>16 ounces coffee : 16 cups / 4 quarts / 1 gallon water</li>
</ul>

<p>*This is my most common ratio; I consistently get 11 cups of concentrate from 12 cups of water. This results in about 11 pints of coffee when mixed as directed.</p>

<p><strong>Useful tools:</strong></p>

<p>1) Large container in which to brew. Make sure you can cover the container to keep out contaminants. A pitcher or carafe with lid is ideal, and a wide-mouth will help with cleanup and removal of the used grounds. My preference is glass but plastic may be adequate. Previously I had recommended the Bormioli Rocco Airtight Jar in 5 liter capacity but have found that it isn’t ideal when brewing with a bag.</p>

<p>2) A sieve, bag, or both to strain the mixture after brewing and before filtering. A nut-milk bag is especially useful - I've been using one to brew and it has made the filtering process quite a lot quicker, cleaner, and easier than filtering with a sieve alone.</p>

<p>3) A fine filter to remove the smaller silt from the mixture. A regular paper coffee filter is the perfect tool for this step, naturally, and you can use the sieve mentioned above to support it.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<p>Measure out coffee and water separately.</p>

<p>If you're using a bag to brew, place the bag in to the container, then fill the bag with the coffee.</p>

<p>If you're not using a bag, simply put the coffee in to the container.</p>

<p>Slowly pour the water over the coffee to soak the grounds completely.</p>

<p>Close up your container for about 10 minutes in order to allow for the coffee grounds to become saturated through.</p>

<p>If you're not using a bag, you'll notice all the grounds at the top of the mixture at the end of the waiting period; if you are using a bag you probably won't notice any difference. In either case, use a non-metal (wooden or plastic) spoon or spatula to submerge the grounds in to the mixture. If you're using the bag, treat it like a teabag and simply dunk it repeatedly. If you're not using a bag, you can mix vigorously.</p>

<p>Allow to brew for 24 hours at room temperature. Periodically you may wish to agitate the mixture as the grounds may sink to the bottom if you're not using a bag, and we want to maximize the coffee grounds contact with the water in order to maximize the flavor extraction.</p>

<p>After 24 hours, strain &amp; filter out coffee grains.</p>

<p>Bag method:
 - Remove bag
 - Empty grounds in to bin and rinse bag
 - Pour mixture through paper filter in to storage container</p>

<p>Sieve method:
 - Pour mixture slowly through sieve in to intermediate container
 - Empty sieve as necessary through process
 - Pour mixture through paper filter in to storage container</p>

<p>The strained mixture will be a concentrated brew of the most delicious nectar of nature. Mix resulting concentrate with water at 1:1 ratio to serve; my preference is chilled with ice but it's also quite delicious if boiling water is added to the room temperature concentrate.</p>

3395,2,,2017-02-07T18:16:01.217,2,,"<p>I have no specific experience with this cold brew device but a general understanding of how extraction works and experience with other devices. In short, you can definitely use water at room temperature to make cold brew (I think it is better), but there seem to be some specific issues with this cold brew maker.</p>

<p>In general the colder the water, the slower it will extract the solid compounds from the coffee. This is the main thing you have to keep in mind, because you will have to adjust some other variables in order to reach the right extraction. In their instructions they suggest you use a medium grind level. This is one variable you could change. Instead of a medium grind level I would use a medium to coarse grind. Another variable that you could change is the brew time. They set the device to 1 drop per second but you could increase that a little to speed up the brewing process, resulting in less extraction.</p>

<p>Specifically with this device there seems to be the problem, that air bubbles block the valve (see the FAQ on the website). They argue that the changing water temperature is responsible for the bubbles to appear. However if you brew at room temperature the water temperature should be much more consistent than with ice water which will obviously melt eventually and then the water will warm up. So I'm not quite sure about their logic (unless you are supposed to add ice until the brewing is over).</p>

<p>I suggest you go ahead and try it at room temperature, adjusting the other variables. Make sure you pre infuse properly so the grounds degas as much as possible, that should prevent too much gas blocking the valve. Alternatively you could use refrigerated water and brew it in the fridge.
Hope this helps, in the end it's a lot of trial and error anyways. Have fun brewing.</p>

<p>If you put in one heaping (rounded) scoop of coffee, that's 14 grams or 3 tablespoons, according to <a href=""https://aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">their FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>While you're on the FAQ page, it answers interesting questions like about gentler coffee:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... about one-fifth the acidity of drip brewed coffee and one-ninth the acidity of French press brewed coffee. Because of this it’s easier on your stomach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a web page <a href=""http://aerobie.com/aeropress/aeropress-vs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">comparing AeroPress</a> with French Press and other kinds of coffee makers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>French presses use coarsely ground coffee because of the size of the holes in their filters. The coarsely ground coffee particles have less surface area than finely ground coffee. The lower surface area necessitates a long steeping time to extract full coffee flavor. Unfortunately, this results in bitterness and acidity in the cup. The AeroPress uses espresso or fine-drip grind coffee with a big surface area to quickly extract rich, full flavor without bitterness.</p>
<p>The coarsely ground coffee required by French press filters unfortunately includes some small particles which pass through the filter and into your cup. These particles continue to leach bitterness leading to a harsh, gritty brew. AeroPress brewed coffee is micro filtered so it is pure and particle free.</p>
<p>French presses cannot produce espresso style coffee and therefore the drinks that can be made with it. The AeroPress can produce regular American style coffee or an espresso style concentrate which can be used like espresso in espresso based drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.</p>
<p>All ground coffee contains the molecules cafestol and kahweol, two molecules which raise LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. The metal filters in French presses do not filter out cafestol and kahweol. The AeroPress’s paper filters do remove them, meaning that AeroPress brewed coffee is free of these harmful elements.</p>
<p>French presses are notoriously difficult to clean. The AeroPress is essentially self cleaning, requiring only a quick rinse.</p>

I can waste more in the FP but it does not really make it better, and if I take two cups off the same grounds, the second one is always inferior, so I just pared down what I was putting in until the first cup was still good, and clean it out and put in a second cup's worth for the second cup (need to dig the big one out of storage one of these days, it would be more efficient.)</p>

<p>I seem to recall that K-cup sizes max out around 10 ounces, not the 13.5+ that 400 ml is. They use the same pod to brew 6 or 8 ounces (based on the one machine I see and avoid using regularly, having tasted its ""product"" and wondered what all the hype was about.) At 6 or 8 ounces, it's in the realm of half your ""cup."" But my FP cup and yours are about the same.</p>

<p>I do not (as seems to be preached a lot) grind particularly coarse for FP. I don't mind a little bit of fine grounds ending up in the cup, reminiscent of Turkish, but not so much.</p>

<p>I also brew somewhat below the widely preached ""standard"" temperature as I like the results better; Sometimes I also cold-brew in the FP by filling it with cold tapwater and grounds the night before.</p>

3409,2,,2017-02-13T14:55:54.493,11,,"<p>I own this machine and have since moved on from it for the exact reasons you stated.</p>

<p>It is possible to create microfoam that is good enough for making clearly defined latte art on the Delonghi Dedica but it requires practice (as would doing the same on any machine). You did the right thing by removing the metal sleeve but the main problem is that the steam power is relatively weak and so it makes it harder to create the vortex required to properly incorporate the aerated milk. Focus on trying to create a spinning vortex/whirlpool type effect in your milk as this is the most important step in ensuring you end up with silky milk.</p>

<ol>
<li>Aerate the milk by keeping the tip of the steam wand near the surface of the milk. You should hear spitting noises. This will introduce air into the milk.</li>
<li>Once you have aerated enough, dip the tip of the steam wand below the surface and try to form a vortex/whirlpool.</li>
<li>Spin the milk as in step 2 until the milk is at the right temperature.</li>
</ol>

<p>For good latte milk, you should not over-aerate. A good starting point is simply raising the height of the milk in your pitcher by about a centimetre. Once again, however, it will require practice and even then it may not be perfect due to the lack of steaming power this machine has.</p>

<p>The Delonghi Dedica also uses a pressurised portafilter basket which means that the crema you find in your cup is a result of artificial pressures produced inside the basket (similar to how Nespresso machines make their 'crema'). You can attempt to create darker crema by making the pressurised basket not the limiting factor of extraction by grinding finer (but not so fine as to choke the machine).</p>

<p>Temperature-wise, you want to ensure that your portafilter is heated by running empty shots through it as it will cool down the shot as it moves through the portafilter. The steam is also not as hot as commercial machines as they have dedicated boilers for the steaming rather than interchanging between functions within a few seconds like the Delonghi.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if you enjoy your coffee the way you make it, stick with the Delonghi Dedica but if you put a lot of value in the quality of the crema and being able to pour latte art then you might want to consider an upgrade or investing more time into practicing milk steaming.</p>

3413,2,,2017-02-14T23:36:40.390,3,,"<p>I'd start by contacting their <a href=""http://www.delonghi.com/en-us/customer-service"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">customer support</a> for a service manual and for tips on this particular problem.</p>

<p>The key idea in debugging (diagnosing) is to think of hypotheses that could explain it, and ways to test those hypotheses, then do the tests.</p>

<p>E.g. for this symptom, my first hypothesis is that there's a switch or optical sensor or other sensor to protect the mechanism, and the sensor could be clogged or covered with gunk.</p>

<p>It's good to think of multiple hypotheses and tests to distinguish between them. So here's another: The mechanism itself could be clogged with gunk, and after detecting too much load or force, the control software backs off for protection.</p>

<p>A test for both of these hypotheses is to open the machine and clean the works. The difference between the two hypotheses is whether it's the sensor or the mechanism that needs cleaning.</p>

<p>The service manual would help with hypothesis generation and testing. What start up checks does it do? What &amp; where are the sensors? What parts need to work properly for the grinder engagement mechanism to work?</p>

<p>Another hypothesis: The mechanism needs lubrication. The service manual should indicate what to lubricate, what not to lubricate, and what lube to use. Or you could guess.</p>

<p>Another hypothesis is a rubber O-ring has worn out or broken. This is also consistent with what you've written, i.e. your existing experience can rule out some hypotheses. It can also make other hypotheses less likely, e.g. if the cause is the same as last time (not a sure bet), a burned out motor would've cost you for parts, while a worn out O-ring might not have.</p>

<p>Also: There are local and online repair clinics to help with appliance repair.</p>

<p>It's worth trying. In the worst case, you spend some time and learn something.</p>

Aside from getting some pointers along the way, the key is practice. It took me years to master consistently steamed milk worthy of latte art. You'll probably get something decent if you keep working at it, but then you'll lose it, and you'll go back and forth in that cycle (unless you pick up a job at a coffee shop and make 100 drinks/day). Anyway, here's some pointers to get you started.</p>

<ol>
<li>Incorporate as much air as you can until the milk roughly reaches the temperature of your hand (think 95 - 105 F). You're going to need all that air, as the steam wand doesn't have enough power to work with less air. Then dip the  wand for the remainder of the time, trying to fold all those bubbles into the milk. Steam until you can't bare to touch the pitcher anymore, then wait an additional 5-10 seconds (I wait for about 2 seconds on my machine, but yours will take a bit longer).</li>
<li>You're probably not going to be able to get a vortex going. If you can, great, but if not, it's not the secret to microfoam. It just helps fold the bubbles in.</li>
<li>What kind of pitcher are you using? You'll need something with a pointed tip (i.e. don't use one that is marketed for latte art). <a href=""http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/320995460977-0-1/s-l1000.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here's what I use</a>. Rounded pitchers, like the one at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond suck!</li>
</ol>

<p>I can't really help with the espresso. I've found that to be totally dependent on the machine you have.  You could try Shiri's advice. You could try preinfusion (google it). You could try pulling it shorter, so it doesn't get watered down too much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the global coffee supply is currently at risk, with shortages already starting to affect the world.</p>
<p>half of the world's area that's deemed suitable for growing coffee will be lost by 2050 if climate change remains unchecked, <strong><a href=""http://fairtrade.com.au/%7E/media/fairtrade%20australasia/files/resources%20for%20pages%20-%20reports%20standards%20and%20policies/tci_a_brewing_storm_final_24082016_web.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">according to a new report</a></strong> from <a href=""http://climateinstitute.org.au/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Climate Institute of Australia</a>.</p>
<p>By 2080, the report estimates that wild coffee (which helps us find genetic varietals that might be more resistant to climate stress) could go extinct.</p>
<p>Temperature and heavy rain have helped a fungus called Coffee Leaf Rust spread through Central America and into South America, destroying crops. Pests like the Coffee Berry Borer are spreading for the same reasons.</p>
<p>Even a half a degree of temperature change can make a region that used to be a coffee gold mine unsuitable. Moving production to higher altitudes is not always feasible and can be especially difficult for the small farmers that make up 80-90% of coffee growers.</p>
<p>By 2050, half of currently suitable land will no longer be suitable, unless the world can limit warming to the 1.5-2 degree Celsius rise that was set as a goal at the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, and really, even 1.5 degrees is pushing it for most farmers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 120 million people in more than 70 countries rely
on the coffee value chain for their livelihoods.</li>
<li>Many countries where coffee exports form a main
plank of the economy are also amongst the most
vulnerable to climate risk.</li>
<li>Crop adaptation strategies include developing more
resilient production systems, diversifying crops,
and shifting plantations upslope. The global trend,
however, is towards intensification as producers
seek to lift yields at the expense of more complex
and carbon-rich landscapes. Ultimately, climate
change is likely to push many producers out of coffee
altogether.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Coffee grown on commercial plantations, like many other crops grown to produce high yields, lack genetic diversity — and are thus highly susceptible to disease. Wild Arabica, which makes up just 5% of Ethiopia’s coffee crop compared to other kinds of coffee, is thought to account for over 98% of the coffee bean’s gene pool and has an estimated value to the coffee industry of almost $1.5 billion per year.</p>
<p>If disease or climate change causes a die-off of commercially grown Arabica, it’d still be possible to re-engineer it from a wider genetic pool — which is why wild Arabica is so precious.</p>

From the taste there is not big difference having the hole or not. With the hole the mocca is even a little stronger, boiling time is a little longer.

<p>I travel often and like to stop at local coffee shops. My beverage of choice is a Caffe Macchiato. In the US, there seems to be the issue that a ""Macchiato"" at Starbucks is something different from an actual Macchiato. </p>

<p>From Wikipedia, this is what I consider a Macchiato:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffè macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed.
  [...] The caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have run into this a few times, even at coffee shops that seem to make a big deal about their coffee knowledge etc. I order a Macchiato, and receive a huge cup with mostly milk and some espresso. </p>

<p>I would like to be clear as to what I want when I order, but I also want to avoid sounding like a jerk if I specify exactly what I want, or sounding dumb if I describe the drink rather than ordering by its name. What is a good way of achieving this?</p>

The plastic in the filter ""cone"" should be food safe, though durability may be an eventual concern.  The plastic cup base can definitely be reused, as is intended.</p>

<p>As far as the practicality concerns go, it may be more of a pain than it's worth.  The coffee containing part of the filter funnel is going to be pretty well attached, in order to keep it from slipping into the cup below and steeping (like tea) vs. simply having the water run through it.  You could probably remove the coffee filter and perch a coffee pod in it's place, but it would not be sealed to the plastic cone, and hot water may run around it without actually percolating through the coffee grounds in the pod.</p>

3438,2,,2017-02-28T17:19:21.503,9,,"<p>The problem with ordering a ""Macchiato"" is that it's only <em>half</em> of the name of a traditional coffee drink.</p>

<p>""Macchiato"" means ""stained"" or ""flecked"" and not more.</p>

<p>In Italy, you have either </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Latte macchiato:</strong> *Milk ""stained"" with coffee (more precisely caffè or espresso) or</li>
<li><strong>Espresso macchiato:</strong> Espresso (or caffè) ""stained"" with a spoonful of milk foam.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you order a ""Macciato"" without qualifier, you will either get what the chain defines as such (for Starbucks, a lot of milk and foam with one or multiple shots of espresso) or what your barista thinks of first - and that would often be a (<em>latte</em>) macchiato, i.e. a glass of milk and foam with an espresso layer inbetween. </p>

<p>So my recommendation is:</p>

<p>If you want a serving of espresso with a bit of milk, order an <strong><em>espresso</strong> macchiato</em>. I just double-checked with the Starbucks US website and yes, they do have espresso macchiato on the menu. Any decent barista from the (self proclaimed) high-end places you mention should be familiar with these terms anyway. The fine difference between ""coffee"" and ""caffè"" (see below) might be ""lost in translation"" and they will be using an espresso machine in 99% of all cases anyway.</p>

<p>Comment re. your Wikipedia link:</p>

<p>Please note the spelling: <em>caffè</em> is not the same as American <em>coffee</em>! The former is what you get when you use a stovetop <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"" rel=""noreferrer"">moka pot</a>, which creates a brew similar (but not identical) to espresso. Both are served in rather small serving units and for coffee drinks used somewhat interchangeably.

3446,2,,2017-03-03T20:28:42.080,4,,"<p>First things first, let's put the difference between French press and manual pour-over:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>French-press</strong>: Coffee and water stay in the same container during brewing. The water is not very close to boiling temperatures. You wait for a while to brew it. At the end, the output is coffee with some fine residue of coffee ground in it. This may continue to brew while you drink. So, it must be consumed fast.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manual pour-over</strong>: Coffee and water are in two different compartments. (This is a very definitive difference.) Brewing happens fast, with close to boiling temperatures. The output has no visible grounds in it. You may wait for a while till it gets colder.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>And, the answer... How could we define the quality? I think it depends on the drinker's mood. I change my brewing method from day to day. I drink cold brew for a while, then two shots of espresso, then a Turkish. I never thought one of them has superior quality.</p>
",1848,2017-03-03T20:28:42.080,,,,0,,CC BY-SA 3.0,,,3445,,,,
3447,2,,2017-03-06T03:24:54.460,2,,"<p>It's relatively difficult to define quality differences without knowing how you're grinding it.</p>

<p>Grinding may be the most influential aspect in your case. If you're grinding with just a basic blade grinder, your grounds are extremely inconsistent. Regardless of your brewing method, your result will be quite different from the results of a grinder with better consistency. The reason has to do with the amount of extraction happening over [time] in relation to the coffee's surface area. If the grounds are large, the surface area is less, so the total extraction per [time] is less. If the grounds are very fine, the surface area is greater, so the total extraction per [time] becomes greater. When your grounds are consistent, you can prepare coffee with greater accuracy. However, if some of your grounds are huge, others medium and others fine, then you have very little control over accuracy, and you sort of have to choose between under-extraction for watery results with less undesirables, or over-extraction for fuller results with more undesirables.</p>

<p>If you are using a blade grinder, I recommend over-grinding for more consistent results. Then just shorten your brew time in order to not over-extract.</p>

<p>In the event that you're using a pretty decent grinder, then how coarse/fine you're grinding the coffee is probably the second most influential aspect. If your grounds are fine, then more grounds are likely to pass through the plunger, and you'll also have to put more force on the plunger, possibly pushing even more grounds through. The more grounds that pass through lengthen the total extraction, even after you pour it out. To be honest, this usually makes a small difference that <em>most</em> people cannot detect it, and those who can do not often care. So relatively speaking, in this case the pour-over may be considered the better option. However, if you're grinder can produce evenly coarse grounds, with little to no powder, then the french press is an equally good method.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a notable difference in the flavor between the two. It is said that the coffee from a french-press ""clogs"" your taste buds. And most people can taste the cleaner/thinner quality of coffee that's been filtered through paper. But at the end of the day, it's preference. I have a coffee snob friend who only drinks french press, and another who only drinks pour-over. I enjoy them both.</p>

Also, you definitely you need a very fine grind. Beating it in a mortar  will not do very much (i have tried), and dont try passing it through the grinder twice (it will jam).

<pre><code>Brew at 75F for 12 hours yields TDS of 1.75
Brew at 65F for 13 hours yields TDS of 1.75
Brew at 55F for 14 hours yields TDS of 1.75
...
Brew at 35F for 16 hours yields TDS of 1.75

An unmentioned benefit is that it tends to keep your teeth and mouth relatively clean, in terms of your teeth feeling smoother (like after brushing) however you will get grinds stuck between your teeth..thus requiring you to want to brush your teeth anyways. I'm not certain (speculative) but much like how wood fibers can kill germs perhaps coffee beans might have a similar impact on the many bacteria in your mouth.

<p>First is that the roast is underdeveloped, the beans are old and stale or of bad quality. In that case there's nothing you can do, except getting different beans.</p>

<p>The second option is that your expectations are off. However the way you describe the lack of taste I'd say it is probably the first option.</p>

<p>Vietnamese coffee is usually Robusta which lacks flavor compared to Arabica. I never tried to cold brew Robusta as it is usually used in Espresso blends, but what you describe is kind of what I'd expect to get (except I'd have guessed it would be bitter). Vietnamese coffees also tend to be on the darker roast side, as they are commonly served with sweetened condensed milk, while cold brew works best with lighter roasts. A lighter roast means also that more of the fruity, floral and acidic flavors are retained in the bean which adds to the complexity of the cup. Washed Ethiopian coffees or Central American coffees work best in my opinion. I prefer washed, but natural works as well. With natural coffees cold brew will usually bring out the red berry flavors even more and sometimes it can be too much in my opinion. Especially when making a concentrate as you are trying to do.</p>

<p>So get some quality light roast Arabica beans and try it again I suggest, because your setup and process is fine.</p>

I bought a bag of coffee grounds and a coffee dripper online. The dripper is a stainless steel type with a couple fine mesh filters in it, which lets me do pour overs without a paper filter.</p>

<p>Here's my method: I'm putting 3 tablespoons of grounds into my dripper, and then with a kettle of 17oz, just off the boiling water, begin pouring over my grounds with enough water to fill the dripper half full. I wait 10 seconds while the grounds bloom and then I fill the dripper to the top and wait for the coffee to brew. Then, when the dripper gets about half empty, I fill it back up with water. I intend to end with ~16oz of coffee.</p>

<p>My problem is that the grounds end up plugging up my dripper and the drip process ends up taking forever. By the time all the water has passed through my coffee grounds and dripper the coffee is COLD!</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Am I trying to get too much coffee out of the pour-over method? Is it really only meant for a single cup serving? Like 6oz and 1 tablespoon of grounds? Are my grounds not fine enough?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Despite what everyone is saying here, I've done a little research and I've read that when doing pour overs, you want your grind to be more fine. They say the consistency of sugar, not sea salt. I find a little truth to this in that when I originally bought the dripper, I used a bag that had grounds that have been much more fine that what I've been using lately. Needless to say, I think I just need to experiment with it.</p>

Surely enough, the diameter of the dripper's lower throughput sieve<br>

You could probably make the grounds <em>coarser</em> to prevent clogging (e.g., pebbles wouldn't clog your filter's water passage way, sand would), but when you go too coarse, the throughout may become too fast and you'll get thin coffee without proper substance/taste. So you'll have to find​ d your optimal configuration.<br>
How you pour water has an effect, as well. Pouring too quickly may lead to pressure that contributes to clogging. Don't pour all the water at once, have a slow steady stream that you distribute over the uoper surface of the grounds. Keep the falling distance for the water/the distance between your hot water output and.the coffee grounds' surface minimal (=less velocity -> less pressure).</p>

<p>Also, pour hot water into the container your dripper is supposed to drip into prior to brewing, let it warm up (it doesn't have to be all filled up, you can sway it/close and rotate it to distribute the heat - don't waste too much energy), then empty just prior to dripping. How long you should optimally warm up depends on your container material, of course - a thick mug warmed up long enough will retain heat for a long, good time :) Thin porcelain doesn't need long warming, obviously.<br>
You can also warm up the cup by microwaving it with a little water inside (be careful not to have the water evaporate/ overheat the cup), but I've found microwaves often don't heat up uniformly...  </p>

<p>P.s.: When getting rid of the warm water, you can first pour it through your empty coffee dripper, so <em>that</em> is also warmed up (no need for extra water on that, it's thin metal with little heat resistance, anyways, so pouring through warm water will most likely do the trick)</p>

If your coffee granules are a similar size to the mesh, they'll just lodge in and very little liquid will be able to get through. Obviously a finer grind will fall through, so try a coarser grind for better water flow.</p>

<p>If you do like your brew with a finer grind though, you might be better off with a paper filter in a V60 instead.</p>

3489,2,,2017-03-31T17:22:51.267,4,,"<p>You need to use a coarser grind.  You have grounds that are just the right size to block the mesh. Too small and they'll just pass through, making your coffee gritty.  Medium-sized and they'll block the mesh.  Large (coarse) enough, and coffee can flow around them.  Not too large: you won't be able to extract enough from the beans with this brewing method using very coarse grounds.</p>

<p>How are you grinding now?  If you're using a blade grinder, you'll often get a large variety of grain sizes (from very fine to very coarse), which means those medium and fine grains will start to clog to holes, even if much of the grounds are coarse.  A burr grinder will give you more consistency.</p>

<p>Personally, I would recommend a plastic or ceramic pour-over brewer, which uses a paper filter.  This method is much more forgiving.  Paper filters won't get clogged with medium grains, and fine grains won't pass through.  I can easily brew 8-16 ounces with my ""single-cup"" pour-over brewer.</p>

<p>One last suggestion: Give your bloom more than 10 seconds!  60 seconds will give your grounds enough time to fully bloom and become ready for further brewing.</p>

3490,2,,2017-03-31T17:36:16.813,2,,"<p>It sounds like the main thing you're not carefully controlling for is <strong>temperature</strong>.  I have found that if I use cooler temperatures (80-92 degrees celsius) for my pour-over, I get very bright/acidic tones.  Hotter water (92-100 degrees celsius) always gives me more bitterness and earthy flavors.  I use an electric kettle with a thermometer to maintain the temperature accurately so I can keep a temperature in the middle, in order to get both sets of flavors.  I would guess that by 2:45, your water is too cool and you're just extracting the acidic notes.  Try keeping your water hotter (and measure to see what temperature you're using).  </p>

<p>I might also suggest giving your coffee a nice 60 second bloom time (pour enough water over them to get them wet, then wait for the gas to escape).  That helps you extract everything (complex and bitter notes included) from the grounds.</p>

<p>You could also consider letting your coffee age a bit longer.  Sometimes, beans are best 7+ days after roasting.</p>

I originally though that the espresso maker would be stronger because it forced steam through the granules, but now am starting to lean towards a french press as long as I let it sit in the water for longer than around 5 minutes. I am basing everything on theories right now though, so I was wandering if anyone had any evidence supporting the facts on either side.</p>

Actually any type of filter coffee (V60, aeropress, frenchpress), since espresso is brewed for about 30s, while filter takes about 3 minutes. 
I used to think that espresso is strong, because of the taste, but it is relatively weak compared to the filter coffee.</p>

3493,2,,2017-04-01T16:00:41.467,2,,"<p>If you are making just a regular black coffee, French Press would be a superior brewing method.  There are a lot of different camps on this, but rarely does an espresso machine get listed as a preferred method of brewing a cup of coffee (technically you are making Americanos I suppose since you would be diluting the espresso extract with water?)</p>

<p>As for a discussion of preferred brewing methods, it depends on what you are after.  French Press tends to lend additional body and heaviness to a cup of coffee. This is predominantly due to the fact that the water is in extended contact with the grounds (4-5 minutes) which allows less soluble molecules to extract from the grounds.  These less soluble molecules tend to have higher atomic weight, which lends a heavier mouthfeel (Modulating the Roast touches on this).  Additionally, french press doesn't filter out fines.  This adds body, but also muddles lighter flavors in the coffee.</p>

<p>If you are after a cleaner more defined cup of coffee, then I would point you to pour over or even a high quality drip brewer (Bonavita makes great coffee imo).  You are going to get better extract filtration, and the timing with water touching grounds tends to highlight the more delicate flavors in the coffee. </p>

<p>Right now I am sipping on a cup of Ethiopian that has a strong raspberry flavor to it even to the untrained palette.  If I were to have brewed this in a French Press, that high note in the coffee would be obscured.</p>

<p>One more note and I'll stop rambling.. as for energy boost, I feel like espresso makes you crash and traditional brewing methods don't.  That is my experience at least.</p>

<p>As to your actual problem, it is probably grounds obstruction, scaling, failing pump, or an over-filled k-cup.  Descaling may help, otherwise it's either brew lighter coffee or replace the machine.  Unfortunately not a lot of good options.</p>

<p>Really you pay for the following on a machine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Looks</li>
<li>Water Temperature Control</li>
<li>Proper design of brewing (water shower, pump rate, cone / basket design)</li>
<li>Brand</li>
</ul>

<p>Older drip brewers lacked a few things.  The brewing chambers were simplistic, but the biggest downside was lack of accurate temperature control.  Water needs to ideally be right at 205 F plus or minus a few degrees depending on coffee type, roast and age.  Newer drip brewers rely on updated electronics that can accurately keep the water temperature in this narrow range which is going to give you improved coffee.</p>

<p>Look at the shower head at the top of the brew chamber.  Does it pour the water down in a single stream, or does it distribute the water nicely across the grounds?  This makes a difference in brew quality and on newer machines, more thought has gone into this design.</p>

<p>Pump rate -- if you read up on how people do pour over, a lot of focus is on timing.  Allowing the coffee to bloom, then proper water per minute rates must be adhered to.  All of these details will change the flavor of the coffee.  Newer machines again have better control over these variables due to improved electronics which allow them to produce more consistent, and hopefully better coffee.</p>

<p>Thermal Carafe -- I just had to throw this in here; these machines brew into an insulated carafe rather than a non-insulated carafe with heater underneath.  In my opinion, thermal carafes are amazing, and they have become much more available now that they once were.  Nothing will kill your coffee faster than a carafe 'warmer' (I mean cooker...) under a non-insulated carafe.</p>

<p>You mentioned Keurig.  Keurig is a whole different animal unfortunately.  They have managed to corner the market on a particular brewing style (which by the way is inferior to old fashioned methods), albeit more convenient.  You get the perks of the newer machines mentioned above in a $300 Keurig machine, but I don't believe the grounds chamber is big enough to actually brew a full cup of coffee, and I believe it brews too quickly to get a fully developed cup of coffee.  Read thin and bright coffee compared to pour over, french press, quality drip.  $200 bucks of the $300 goes either to the electronics of allowing you to brew a single cup at a time, validating it is a legit k-cup (they did away with the microchips in K-Cups I think?) or simply name brand.</p>

I did, but the Brix scale of 0-30 or whatever it is makes it nearly impossible to read any difference between coffees unless you are comparing a very over extracted vs. a very under extracted.

<p>I do have an online marketplace (www.sajecreekcoffee.com) but I have found that working locally is much better.  Online is flooded with potential options, and getting someone to know your brand name is difficult.  I believe with time, online will be a fantastic sales channel, but it will take a lot of hard work to build the brand recognition to that point.</p>

<p>Lots of people like to go local now days, and a lot of people have expressed interest in carrying locally roasted products.  Coffee shops, farmers markets, craft shows are where we are focusing locally to get our brand out there.  We strongly believe that we have a high quality product at a fair price, so if we can simply get people to try our coffee, the coffee should do the selling for us.</p>

<p>Lastly, on mail, we are doing USPS priority.  Shipping has been a huge pain because of costs.  Unfortunately coffee is a low value per ounce product, and so shipping costs are pretty high.  That being said, we can get 2 lbs of product into a padded mailer, and up to 7 lbs into a medium flat rate box.  We are in the process of ordering custom boxes to reduce that price more.  USPS tends to give better prices for 'heavy' items compared to UPS / FedEx.  Also, my day job is writing fulfillment software for a company that operates three reasonably large online wholesale outlets, so I've had to mess with shipping a lot.</p>

<p>One thing to consider.  As soon as you sell online, then you enter the FDA's jurisdiction since you are selling a 'food product' across state lines.  This shouldn't have any major impact unless they decide to do a random inspection which I've been told happens every couple years on average.</p>

<p>First, determine how you like your coffee when its a regular cup of joe.  Once you know how much milk you use to however much coffee, determine how much powdered milk reconstitutes to the equivalent amount of regular milk.  Then determine how much instant coffee in a glass of hot water makes a comparably sized cup of regular black coffee.  When you've done that, you should have measurements for how much instant coffee and how much powdered milk you need for one cup of coffee.  (Be sure to make a test cup!) </p>

<p>Then for ease of use on the trail I would scale up the amounts based on how long of a trip and how many cups of coffee you think you'll want and combine the coffee and milk powders.  Thoroughly mixed, they can be stored in a single container, and since you know how much instant coffee and how much powdered milk to use separately in a given amount of hot water, you can add those amounts to know how much of the mix to put in your cup on the trail.  </p>

Too fine of a grind produces excessively long brew times and too coarse of a grind produces too short brew times.</p>

<p>If your brew time is too short, the coffee will taste sour. If it is too long, the coffee will be bitter.</p>

<p>Other factors that influence the appearance of these undesirable flavors are the consistency of the grind and the temperature of the water. If your grind is not consistent it will have particles of varying size. The finer particles will extract quickly and then impart bitter flavors to the coffee. And the coarsest particles will be under-extracted and will impart sour flavors. Both will be present in coffee that is incorrectly ground.</p>

<p>Water temperature also affects the appearance of these flavors. Under-heated water will under-extract the coffee and overheated water will over-extract it.</p>

<p>To maintain your sanity while adjusting these variables it is best to use the same amount of coffee and water each time you brew and to follow the same technique when pouring. Don't measure the coffee by volume but rather by weight. The same volume of coffee ground to different particle sizes can vary greatly in weight. And don't mix units of measure. Grams are far more of an accurate unit of measure than ounces. To keep your coffee to water ratio constant you'll also want to weigh the water as you pour it.</p>

<p>A common kitchen scale and timer are all you need for this. Your water should be between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit. And for a starting guideline for total brewing time try aiming for a three to four minute brew time window. Begin with a coffee to water ratio of 1:16. After you get the other factors figured out you can adjust the ratio to get the strength of brew you prefer. While experimenting vary only one thing per brew until you can dial in the perfect settings for your taste. The final judge of your results is whether you like it.</p>

If less brewing time=less bitter,then does coffee made with a french press inherently taste more bitter than other methods? (Maybe people that use the french press prefer more bitterness?) I also read a post elsewhere from a person who says she bought a single-cup coffee filter holder with three holes at the bottom rather than the typical one hole, and that the coffee tasted better because the water drained more quickly. Does the faster the coffee passes through a filter make it less bitter? If so, I wonder why the three hole filter holder isn't more sold more frequently.

There are a couple of other links to coffee bitterness in that question also.</p>

<p>Keeping other major factors constant (e.g., same temperature of water, same beans), <em>time and grind level</em> are the easiest to modify to reduce bitterness. That is: <strong>shorter time</strong> and <strong>coarser grind</strong> will (generally) result in less bitter coffee. While you certainly can't expect to get a reasonable brew from barely chopped beans in 15 seconds, small changes in time and grind level can have a noticeable impact on outcomes, especially for immersion-style brewing methods like French press, Aeropress, pour-over, and to a lesser extent stovetop methods like percolator or moka.</p>

<p>Specifics vary by brewing method. For instance, some bitter-tasting compounds are filtered out by paper filters, so paper-filter pour-over will generally be less bitter than French press, for example. Also, your average paper filter will allow brewed coffee to filter more quickly with a coarser grind (finer grinds will more quickly clog the filter) so you might have to vary your pouring method to keep the total brewing time constant.</p>

3514,2,,2017-04-10T17:04:49.857,2,,"<p>The comment on the Moka pot I believe has a bit more complex answer than what you are indicating.  Moka Pots are almost more similar to an espresso brewing method than a french press or a pour over system.  Water very near boiling is forced through a coffee puck at some level of increased pressure which brews your coffee.  Just looking at the mechanical system that is being used, it appears to me that if you were to leave the pot on the stove just slightly longer than intended, your coffee would brew with a higher temp water, at higher pressure.  Both of these can cause bitterness.  I think the comment stating that increased time on the stove = more bitter coffee doesn't have to do with brew times, but rather, has to do with water temp and pressure.</p>

<p>A lot of what you are asking comes down to the chemistry of the molecules in the coffee grounds.  When water is applied to the coffee grounds, the first compounds to extract are citric and malic acids followed by more complex (and less soluble compounds).  The compounds which contribute heavy body tend to have high atomic weight, and are not very soluble.</p>

<p>Presuming your grind, water temp, ratios etc are all the same, then the longer you steep the coffee grounds in water, the more body will be contributed to the final extraction, while a very fast extraction will contribute lots of brightness and acidity.</p>

<p>French press is on the far end of the spectrum for brew times, so the resultant coffee has lots of body, but the lighter flavors tend to be muddled, and the acidity seems blunted.  An additional factor on the french press is that the filters are all in all pretty poor, so you end up with lots of fines in your cup of coffee.  Fines are not dissolved solids, and don't really contribute to anything but mouth feel.  They might lend a bit of body, but really, they leave that nasty last sip of grounds in the bottom of your cup.</p>

<p>Typically drip / pour over are a bit more balanced.  They filter fines, and brew time (ie water contact with grounds, not necessarily total brew time) is shorter, which contributes to a 'cleaner' cup of coffee where the acid and finer notes can be easily perceived, and the body doesn't completely take over.</p>

<p>I have been using a french press exclusively for several months now. I don't particularly like bitter coffee - but I also don't use water nearly as hot as is common with other methods (or pretty much required for them to move water at all, in some cases) - sometimes I let it cold-brew overnight, and otherwise I stick to water at a temperature I can drink without being scalded after it brews for 4-5 minutes (without adding any cold water or milk products.)</p>

<p>I also use a mild/medium roast, not any of the darker roasts. With moderate temperature water, another 10 minutes does not make a big difference over my usual 5. I'm not slaved to using a timer and sometimes I get to doing other things while the coffee steeps.</p>

<p>I advise you to check a previous answer first. It includes a very nice chart and the ideal point for quality brewing of coffee. Also, it shows the extraction ratios, a hint of TDS (total dissolved solids) etc. I copy its link just below:</p>

<p>As you see, if you can manage to brew an ideal coffee, you can extract only around 20% of the valuable ""essence"" from the core of the beans. That's the reason why some of the members of <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/"">Coffee SE</a> tries to re-brew the used grounds for a second time (I assume), as you can follow below:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Then, of course, some other members discuss the TDS part to find the golden brewing point at the first chart. The easiest way to follow that point repeatedly is done by a refractometer. It is a device that can measure opaqueness. So, by measuring the opaqueness of your brew, you may reason on the amount of dissolved coffee ""essence"" in the water; therefore you may estimate the strength of your cup.</p>

3518,1,,2017-04-11T17:11:13.100,8,1232,"<p>I am a coffee roaster and am working through building a standard espresso profile for coffee shops in my area.  I'm working with a particular shop that is interested in my coffee, but for some reason the espresso pulls extremely sour on their machine.  I'm looking for ideas as to what might be going on.  I've done quite a bit of research, so I'll add in what I have done thus far.</p>

<p><strong>My Setup (Shots pull good)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>18g grounds, pulling 2 fl oz with a final weight around 50g</li>
<li>Machine is a Rocket Apartamento, nearly brand new.  Water is filtered, non RO, boiler pressure is at 1.2-1.3 bar.</li>
<li>Grinder is a Breville Dose Control Pro, also new.</li>
<li>Shots are pulling in about 26-28 seconds</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p>Espresso has good crema that stands up for longer than 1 minute and has rich orange / red tones.  Shot is lively, but not sour with no hint of bitterness, and good heavy body.  This isn't a fruit bomb blend or anything, I am more looking for something that a typical coffee shop customer would find palatable.  Espresso stands up to milk very well.  Personally, I almost feel like the roast may be slightly too dark since with milk, I start getting a hint of roasty-ness.</p>

<p><strong>Shop Setup (Sour Shots)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>18g grounds, pulling 36g output (supposedly this is 2 fl oz also, can't verify as I haven't seen markings on the glass they are pulling into.  If anything, I would say it is probably a 2.5-3oz pull)</li>
<li>Machine is A Nuevo Simonelli Aurelia 2.  Boiler pressure 1.4 bar, pump pressure 9.5 to 10 later in the pull. Water is not filtered to my knowledge.</li>
<li>Grinder is a used Mazzer, unknown burr wear (personally I'm thinking this is a likely culprit?)</li>
<li>Shots are timed for a 27-30 second pull.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p>Shots pull extremely bright / sour, crema tends to be closer to a dirty brown color.  This shot might blend with milk and be drinkable, but just barely.</p>

<p>Confusing points for me that may bear some explaination...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Longer pull (and thus probably a finer grind) results in sour coffee, not bitter.</p></li>
<li><p>Higher boiler pressure = higher water temp which tends to scorch if too high and impart more bitter qualities, yet this is sour.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is his 2 fl oz of extract such lower weight than my 2 fl oz.  Crema production is heavy on both machines, but the weight difference almost seems to indicate that the crema on his machine is double or more than what my machine is producing which isn't the case.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Troubleshooting espresso via web forum is pretty difficult but I would appreciate any thoughts on how I might go about getting good shots out of this shop machine.  Oh, btw, it wasn't me pulling the shots at the shop, so tamp could definitely be different between the two shots, but given that the pull times are pretty close together, and I did watch the tamp, I can say that technique is at the very minimum similar.  I can say that both tamps appear to at least be even on a naked portafilter.</p>

3521,2,,2017-04-13T13:24:49.920,4,,"<p>I don't think anyone can really give a definitive answer to this but I'd like to chime in to try to help. It's almost impossible to find your answer because of how many different variables are at play here. You should first focus on minimising the variance in your methods.</p>

<ol>
<li>You describe the shop shot as being a 'longer pull' and thereby expecting more bitter results. The problem with that assumption is that you can only truly compare shot times if you have extracted the same output weight in both cases. Since you have not, you have not only extracted much less in your shop shot, but, like you noted, it also took longer. I normally only ever measure my shots by weight because that's the number that tells me how much water got through and thereby how much real contact and subsequent extraction occurred.<br>
I use time as a secondary reference to diagnose other problems in my shot. If I suddenly start extracting a same weight shot in half the time that I normally do, I know something is definitely off. Since your shop shot extracted much less output weight, the sourness is clearly due to some level of underextraction from being stopped too early (relative to your home shot). In any case, I always try to aim for 30g in 30s, which means you probably need to grind slightly finer in the shop to be able to extract more and try to hit the same balance as your home shot.<br>
You mention your water sources being different. This is huge! You will never find the same shot if you are using filtered at home and unfiltered at the shop depending on how hard the water is when unfiltered.</li>
</ol>

<p>Compare shot times as a secondary to consistent output weight and see how grinding finer in the shop would fare.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Higher boiler pressure does not necessarily point directly towards higher temperatures. Also, higher pressures could impact the puck suddenly when the valve is opened which could crack and cause channeling and therefore underextraction and sourness. Your main issues here are still in point 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Weight difference is purely by choice. Crema production is mostly dependent on freshness of beans and less to do with specifics in extraction method. If preset weight quantities are being used as part of a single button-press on a machine, then your problem starts there. You need to weigh every shot and choose when to stop the shot yourself. Without this control, you're simply relinquishing responsibility of the shot and you are at the mercy of the machine, yet another variable to consider in being able to find the right shot.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion, you MUST minimise variables. Make sure your grind sizes are the same at both locations, ensure your input and output weight are identical, analyse differences in taste and extraction time at same output weight, ensure your sources of water are identical, make sure your tamp pressures are the same. At this point the only real differences will be the machines and then you can start investigating how each machine is affecting the shots. Try to use bottomless portafilters in order to diagnose whether your distribution of your coffee bed was poor and whether channeling occurs during extraction.</p>

<p>Combine all of the parameters above with the taste of your output shots and you'll know the next steps you need to take in finding the problem in your shot.</p>

3530,2,,2017-04-26T16:50:50.003,3,,"<p>The major standards are a bit confusing honestly.  Fair trade provides a baseline above the commodities rates, but they don't ensure that the farmer is getting the most for their product.  Furthermore, the farm has to be able to be certified for conforming to certain environmental conditions prior to being certified.  Many coffee farmers are so far off the beaten path that they simply cannot afford to be certified.  I believe that conscientious importers provide a far better compensation to the farmer.  </p>

<p>It looks like Fair Trade assures something between 15 and 35 cents above commodities rates.  This is far below what a roaster will pay for specialty grade coffee.  While fair trade is a good baseline, if you purchase specialty coffee, you are most likely buying coffee that was purchased for significantly better than fair trade rates.  To give you an idea.. I pulled up a random invoice I had in my inbox and it was $1.70 above commodities rate.  Furthermore, importers provide on the ground support to farmers in the form of varietal education and recommendations, disease prevention, washing technique improvements, all of which net the farmer tangible benefits because their coffee will improve in quality, and thus, sell for more.</p>

<p>So.. if you are looking for good ethical compensation for farmers, I would say look for local specialty roasteries.  These roasteries are purchasing high quality coffee from a high quality importer which means that there are people on the ground helping farmers achieve better quality, and thus better compensation.</p>

<p>The link below is a pretty interesting article from a greens buyer I am thinking about working with.  I found it a very interesting read that gave some insight into what importers actually do, and highlights why a lot of coffee farms are not certified.. </p>

I then came here and there is a recent question about aluminium packaging for preserving beans. This makes me a little confused, because I thought that aluminium, i.e metal, would affect negatively the taste of the beans. Then I read that ceramic can contain a large amount of lead, which makes me even more concerned.</p>

<p>If you were thinking about the perfect storage for your beans, what would be your material of choice? Thank you.</p>

3533,2,,2017-04-28T18:06:18.137,5,,"<p>Typically aluminum packaging is actually a three (or more) layered packaging with aluminum not being in direct contact with the beans.  Aluminum is a superb barrier to air, and it is typically used as an internal layer to prevent air transferring into the bag, without being in direct contact with the beans.</p>

<p>Keys to optimal packaging:</p>

<p>Prevent light from reaching beans.  Light will help to speed oxidation of coffee oils.</p>

<p>Prevent air from reaching beans but don't restrict air from escaping beans!  This is where the 1 way degassing valve comes in.  Coffee will offgas carbon dioxide if it is fresh.  High CO2 levels contribute to oxidation, so you want the ability for that gas to escape without constantly recirculating air in your container (which would also contribute to oxidation).</p>

<p>I think ceramic or dark glass would both be excellent storage solutions provided they have a way to degas the coffee.  These materials (provided they have good methods of sealing the container) would prevent air transfer into the coffee, and would sufficiently block light to prevent oxidation.</p>

<p>An example of an aluminum coffee bag I snagged from the internet has a PET internal liner, Aluminum barrier layer, and an LDPE external layer. So.. basically aluminum sandwiched between foodsafe plastic and something that looks good on a shelf =p</p>

<ol>
<li>The roast. A darker roast may produce a stronger flavor, but maybe you don't like darker roasts. Keep in mind that the cold brewing process will produce a smoother result, so you might be pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
<li>The temperature. You can try putting warmer water into your coffee initially, or warming it up right at the end. This may extract more flavor. Obviously it goes against the principle of cold brewing, and it might extract some flavors you don't like. But it's worth trying to see what you think.</li>
<li>The grind. A finer grind may extract more flavor, but you'll have to pass the concentrate through filter paper in that case. </li>
<li>The ratio of coffee to water. Use less water to more coffee for a stronger flavor.</li>

3544,2,,2017-05-10T20:38:32.643,2,,"<p>That is a simplified 'consumer' version of a coffee flavor wheel that roasters / importers etc use for trying to put words to a coffees flavor.  It is a really good way to try and explain the flavor of the coffee, but honestly, most roasteries won't have the development background or funds to make the fancy background on their products.  </p>

<p>I run my own roastery, and happen to be a software developer as well and to get that to work on my site would take quite a bit of customization.</p>

<p>My recommendation would be to familiarize yourself with a standard SCAA flavor wheel and pay attention to the cupping notes on each coffee.  Here's the caveat.  If the roaster is terrible, his cupping notes (or flavor wheel graphics) will still probably say the same things as a roaster that is producing high quality coffee.</p>

<p>If you become accustomed to single origin coffees you will be able to immediately go straight to your preferred origins from each roaster faster.  For instance, I have a customers who will only drink Guatemalan coffee because it matches their particular preferences, the same for Ethiopian etc.  If you find that Ethiopian fits your preferred flavors, then you can explore more confidently knowing that most Ethiopian coffees will have a 'similar' flavor profile.  Not all coffees from a particular country will have the same flavor profile, but it's a good place to start if you are looking for something to fit a particular flavor.</p>

<p>A better known fact is:</p>

<ul>
<li>if your coffee is <strong>underextracted</strong>, it tastes <strong>sour</strong>.</li>
<li>if your coffee is <strong>overextracted</strong>, it tastes <strong>bitter</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let's tie up this to grind size:</p>

<ul>
<li>if your grounds are <strong>finer</strong>, your coffee <strong>overextracts</strong> if other conditions are kept stable.</li>
<li>if your grounds are <strong>coarser</strong>, your coffee <strong>underextracts</strong> if other conditions are kept stable.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's known that Moka pots are not controllable devices. So, all the other conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.) are nearly same each time. Thus, it's obvious that your grinding directly affects the taste of your cup. You should be consistent about your grounds. :)</p>

<li>use an arabica bean. Again with all due respect, cold brews work well to tone down some of the bitterness while retaining the other aromas. This translates to using arabica over a robusta.</li>

  <p>I have an MC2 and recently pulled it out after my newer grinder
  breaking down. You can pop the top bit off the grinder (The black
  plastic part) and unscrew the worm-drive mounting. Doing this makes it
  very easy to get access to the top burr plate and unscrew it until it
  comes away. After that use a stiff bristled toothbrush or small
  paintbrush to remove all the ground coffee etc and clean the housing
  out entirely. </p>
  
  <p>Assembly is the opposite of dismantling. As a rule of thumb I tighten
  until the burrs meet (the lower burr moves with the upper) and then
  loosen off about 1/8th of a full turn.</p>
  
  <p>Point to note The wormdrive, while being annoyingly slow to adjust
  needs to be in place for the grinder to remain dialed at any setting.</p>
  
  <p>While on the subject, an easy hack to make adjustments quicker is a
  set of locking pliers (welders pliers) either around the knob or
  straight on the bar. Which makes the whole process a LOT quicker, if
  slightly less elegant.</p>

  <p>just needs a strip down. From what you have said it sounds like the

  fragments. Also could be that one if the screws has come loose so the
  blde is loose on its mount. </p>
  
  <p>Hold the button down that holds the step ring and unscrew the ring.
  This will leave you with the plastic ring and an cast alu mount for
  the top blade. Use a wire brush and clean this blade. Remove it and
  clean the mount, put it back. Next remove the lower blade. To do this
  safely unplug from the mains. To stop the motor turning while you
  unscrew place a large flat blade driver next to one of the fins. Clean
  it all and put it all back together. </p>
  
  <p>Next set the grind to the right courseness. Dose a little onto your
  hand and rub the grouds with your figer. The grouds should be uniform.
  If not you need new blades. These shouldnt cost you anymore than
  £15-20. Makesure you get the right blades as some are right handed &amp;
  some are left. Don't forget, this grinder is made by Cunill and

<p>First off, caffeine levels in dark vs light roasts are often said to be different.  From a chemical perspective caffeine is chemically stable to 455 degrees Fahrenheit (it's melting point).  Due to this, caffeine is not removed during the roasting process unless you are roasting to a Spanish roast, or burned beyond all recognition.  As such, the caffeine inherit in a particular lot of green coffee tends to stay the same amount per bean regardless of roast depth.</p>

<p>The twist..</p>

<p>Roasting will roughly double bean size, and burn off between 12 and 18% of the total weight of a bean.  Due to this, technically, a darker roast has more caffeine by weight than a lighter roast, which is opposite of what I hear a lot of people say.</p>

<p>Now.. on to your question.. If the pods are by weight, I suppose a dark roast will have marginally more caffeine.  Where you get a significant difference in caffeine amounts is when you start looking at different types of coffee.  Robusta coffees for instance tend to be low grown and have adapted to the environment by having higher concentrations of caffeine.  The reason is simply that caffeine is the coffee plants natural pesticide.  That being said, Robusta coffees also tend to be very bitter, hence why they are predominantly used in cheap coffee blends in place of arabica.  The bitterness is directly related to the elevated caffeine, as well as very high concentrations of CGA.</p>

<p>My recommendation is pick what tastes good, because honestly, you aren't going to get a significantly higher amount of caffeine per roast, or lot of beans.</p>

<ul>
<li>Allowing water trough it more easily – else the pressure needs to go too high and your coffee will taste burned as it is roasted a second time from the overheated filter basket <sup>[1]</sup>.</li>
<li>Not allowing small small grounds to ""whirl"" up in the water and reach the top <sup>[2]</sup> and flow into your final coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to this and if above does not help, you <em>can</em> —if needed— still go with what @Ecnerwal suggested as a last ressort.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>[1]</sup> You can avoid a good part of this by using very warm (non boiling) water, instead of cold water. This means the water will boil earlier and the grounds will not get exposed to too much heat over a longer period of time.</p>

<p><sup>[2]</sup> Do not over–power your stove. When I cook my coffee, I turn the (electrical) stove to between level 7–8/12. Using a lower heat not only makes the coffee drinkable and removes a lot of the overly strong and often bitter taste, but also prevents smaller grounds to whirl up as the water has less energy, moves less and allows smaller grounds to sink back into the filter again.</p>

<p>A consistent grind (one with particles in a small range of sizes, neither excessively large nor excessively small) makes it more feasible to get the contribution of all the coffee grounds to the beverage without over-extracting any of the grounds - thus making it possible to get a more consistently predicable cup of coffee, without off flavors from some part of the grounds and no flavor from another part.</p>

<p>Having fine control over the grind size in a consistent grinder makes it possible to adjust the grind to produce the best cup (to your taste) in the equipment you have for brewing.</p>

This allows more oils to pass into the cup (than a paper filter process) and some of them will form a rather small oil slick on the surface. I think you have the oil slick and some fine grounds making up your cup residue. Pouring through a paper filter cone on the way to the cup (after pressing) would reduce or eliminate that (if it bothers you.)</p>

3578,2,,2017-05-30T16:33:27.900,4,,"<p>That looks like fines to me.  In general, ground coffee has two sizes.  The higher quality the grinder, the most consistently the coffee grounds will conform to those two sizes.  One size is the actual grind level, dictated in a burr grinder, by the burr design and how closely they are put together.  The other particle size are the tiny fragments that break off when you fracture two pieces of bean to make the larger particles.  These smaller particles are called 'fines'.  </p>

<p>While you will find fines in every grind level, I believe you get more fines the finer you grind.  Just thinking logically, if you take a bean and break it one time, then you will get x amount of fines.  Break it twice and you get more, etc etc.  Effectively grinding finer, will cause more breaks in the coffee bean, releasing more fines.</p>

<p>Fines tend to slip through the metal mesh of a french press very easily, which is part of the reason the coffee has a heavier mouth feel, as well as muddled high notes.  All that being said, I can't say I have often found a coating of fines high in the cup, rather they tend to sit in the bottom.  This indicates either a huge amount of fines, or as some others have indicated, maybe some crazy combination of oil slick suspending fines?  Recommend reviewing your grind level.  Do you have heavy grinds in the bottom of your cup? If so, you may need to grind more coarse.  French press should be ground at a very coarse setting to help prevent this.  By the look of that cup, I would guess that you may be able to swipe your finger around the edge of the cup to capture all of that stain, and feel some grit between your fingers.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you are using pre-ground coffee, almost 100% guarantee the grind level is wrong.</p>

3581,2,,2017-05-30T21:02:08.443,3,,"<p><strong>Note</strong> All information below is entirely based on my adjustment to make 11 be a french press / cupping grind thus normalizing the rest of the settings.  How I came up with the adjustment was because at the time I had my home grinder configured for french press and was using it daily, and I simply did a comparison of grind levels until the adjustment appeared to be the same size.  Given a normalized 11 setting, everything else should match up.</p>

<p>When I first purchased my EK43, I felt that it did not allow coarse enough grinding to get to French press level grinds.  I pulled the tap screws on the grind adjustment knob and and loosened the burrs equivalent of 2 grind units (effectively making grind level 3 originally a 1).  This adjusted the grinder such that an 11 was a French press grind.</p>

<p>Once this is configured, and presuming you are using the 'new' EK43 burrs, I use the following settings:</p>

<p>11 - French Press and cupping samples</p>

<p>7.5-8 - Drip brew and Keurig depending on desired strength.  This setting will also work with Bunn brewers IF the user uses the proper amount of grounds, which almost no one does.. For 110oz airpots we were using 175g grounds at a 7.5.</p>

<p>4.5 - For those stubborn people who use half as many grounds as they are supposed to on Bunn brewers..  I've got a few companies like this, and have to grind fine, otherwise the coffee comes out underextracted.  I wish I could just tell them to double the amount of coffee they put in the machine but.. oh well.</p>

<p>This setup is basically useless for espresso grinding.  It works halfway decent if you are using a pressurized portafilter (like an EC155 or something) If someone asked for an espresso level grind on this setup, I would give them a 1 and it would be quite fine, but probably wouldn't be clumping at all. No one discerning enough to know the differences in espresso grinds is going to ask for it pre-ground anyways so I just ignore this bit.</p>

<p>All of these settings are with basically brand new burrs.. of course as they wear, I will have to adjust accordingly.</p>

Whenever I'm out and about I always take note of the machines that are used in the brewing and some examples are WMF 1500S, Thermoplan Black &amp; White and Franke A1000.</p>

<p>I'm talking solely about black brewed coffee - no espressos or lattes. Whereas the coffee I get from these machines is aromatic and just the right amount of strong, the coffee I do at home is usually way too acidic and with a very long and overbearing aftertaste.</p>

<p>While I've certainly tasted bad coffee from these high-end machines it is never as bad as the coffee I do at home. I've tried researching how these machines work with the brew head and all but as I'm not an engineer I found that sorta stuff hard to understand.</p>

<p>What I've tried so far:
- 6-7 grams of coffee per 100 ml water
- Waiting 15-60 seconds after boil to allow water to cool down before pouring
- Different types of beans, usually pretty expensive (locally roasted, organic, non-organic, dark, medium, light, etc)
- Different ground levels for pour over
- Different brewing times (1 - 4 min)
- Probably a bunch of other stuff</p>

<p>My kit is:
- Full Hario V60 pour over kit (w/ dripper, server, filters and kettle)
- Melitta pour over dripper
- Kitchen scale
- Wilfa electric grinder (cleaned regularly)
- Bodum french press
- Good water source</p>

",4349,2019-06-04T10:35:14.773,Why does commercially brewed coffee taste so much better?,<coffee-machines>,4,3,2,CC BY-SA 3.0,,,,,,,
3583,2,,2017-05-31T16:32:15.507,3,,"<p>Probably your grind, or your grounds to water ratio is off.</p>

<p>I typically use around 8-9g grounds per 120g water.  At this ratio, you should be getting very strong coffee from a pour over system, and in general it should not be sour.  </p>

<p>What you are describing sounds like under extraction.  This could be caused by a number of things.  I will focus on the pour over system for now and outline possible issues below:</p>

<p><strong><em>Water not hot enough:</em></strong>  It sounds like your method is pretty good for this, but if you are getting sour/very bright flavors, then it is a possible culprit.  Lower temp water will extract fewer compounds per second than higher temp water.</p>

<p><strong><em>Grind level:</em></strong>  This is a high likelyhood, and if a coffee doesn't taste right, this is the first thing I adjust.  For pour over, you should be doing a medium to medium fine grind.  Each person / coffee is going to adjust slightly differently but if you are getting sour / too bright, grind finer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pour speed:</em></strong> Pour over can be a bit of an art with the concentric circles etc.  You should be keeping the grounds saturated without having standing water above the grounds.  Pour too fast, and you will under extract.  Typically to brew about 400ml of extract, I spent 5-6 minutes pouring, maybe a bit longer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Amount of grounds:</em></strong>  You may want to increase the amount of coffee per cup.  As I mentioned, with the coffee I produce, you should be getting a very bold cup of coffee at 9g / 120g water.  I typically tone this down and do maybe 24g for 360g extract?  It still comes out very strong.  If you make all of the above adjustments and still get weak / sour / bright coffee, start adding more grounds.</p>

<p>If your French press is brewing bright, then I would look to water.  French press grind is as coarse as most grinders go, and is very forgiving on extraction.  If you are getting bright / sour coffee in the press, make sure you are allowing it to steep for a good 4-5 minutes, make sure your water is just off boil, and make sure you are using enough grounds.  Again, start with about 8-9g per cup and adjust from there.  Personally I use 7 'scoops' which end up being about 8g each for an 8 cup french press.</p>

<p><strong><em>Just 2 cents of advice</em></strong>
If you are just looking for a good cup of coffee in the morning, I would recommend simple.  I have French Press, Pour Over, Drip Brew, Espresso, Moka Pot brewing systems.  As a coffee roaster, I need to be familiar with all of the common methods of brewing coffee so I can answer questions that might arise.  I use a simple drip brewer for my morning cup of coffee.  I grind on demand, but it is not a bean to cup machine or anything like that.  Currently I use a Cuisinart with a vacuum carafe, and as picky as I could be, it is easy, and it makes good coffee.  Cuisinart and Bonavita both make pretty nice drip brewers for around 100 dollars.</p>

<p>Are you trying to match the taste you get from an auto drip brewer by making your coffee with a v-60?</p>

<p>I use 21 grams of coffee to 12 ounces of water. It's important to note whenever the word ""cup"" is mentioned usually that means 6 ounces of water. </p>

I use a cheap supermarket expresso machine (€50) for example, and it has worked perfectly for 2 years, but you have to grind the coffee correctly with a proper grinder, which is expensive. Done properly, it tastes the same as the expensive machines. Italians can make a good coffee from any beans. That is their way. We normal people need to buy a good brand. </p>

<p>Do you use both baskets that came with the espresso machine?  The EC155 comes with a single shot and double shot basket.  They are pressurized, so if the pressure regulator at the base of the basket is fouled up, it could be preventing water flow.  If you have an unused basket, you could try pulling shots with it to see if water flow is improved.</p>

<p>Does water flow freely with the portafilter removed completely?  If not, then you may have something restricting flow in the screen directly above the portafilter.  You can typically remove this to replace seals, and it may need a good scrubbing.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on backflushing an EC155?  I've never done it, but was shocked with how much oil / espresso nastiness came out when I backflushed my Rocket for the first time. I'm not sure you can backflush an EC-155, as I'm not sure where the built up pressure would be diverted to..</p>

<p>If the screen at the group head looks clean, then I might move on to descaling.</p>

<p>Polished gold or porcelain must be the ideal stirrers as they won't chemically react. I opt for porcelain as it may also help keeping the coffee warm as its thermal conductivity is less than gold.</p>

<p>Comparing the three you mentioned:</p>

<li><p>Wooden: Sometimes I taste it. So, I don't prefer it that much.</p></li>
<li><p>Plastic: There are many polymers we call plastic in our daily life. Some of these things are really of bad quality and I am suspicious if their thermal resistance is adequate for coffee. I wouldn't prefer them, too.</p></li>
<li><p>Metal: Especially, if you mention polished 18/10 stainless steel cutlery, they probably resist the heat and won't react with anything.

3596,2,,2017-06-09T22:09:33.500,1,,"<p>A few considerations when choosing a 'sweet' coffee..</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I saw posted that lower elevation equals more sugar.  Lower elevation also typically signifies higher caffeine which is very bitter.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for light roasts with mild acidity.  Why light roasts?  Coffee beans coloration comes from Maillard reactions, a key component of which is sugar caramelization. While in your mind, caramel is sweet, raw sugar (sucrose for instance) is significantly more sweet than caramelized sugar.</p></li>
<li><p>Why low acidity?  While acidity isn't bad in a coffee, I feel like if you are trying to optimize sweetness, acidity detracts from perceived sweetness. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>It's really difficult to say what origin is most sweet, but it may be a better approach to say what origins have flavor components that might help add to a perceived sweetness.  For me, I like a good Guatemalan or Ethiopian for a clean, brisk sweet cup of coffee.</p>

<p>One other note.. Espresso roasts 'should' be optimized to minimize acidity and bitterness while maintaining as much sweetness as possible.  You may find some espresso beans that will fit the bill for sweetness, but I still think you can find more sweet coffees at lower roast levels.</p>

<ul>
<li>If it tastes <strong>sour</strong>: The problem is <strong>under extraction</strong>, so adjust brew time <strong>longer</strong>, or adjust water temp <strong>cooler</strong>, or adjust grind size <strong>finer</strong>.</li>
<li>If it tastes <strong>bitter</strong>: The problem is <strong>over extraction</strong>, so adjust brew time <strong>shorter</strong>, or adjust water temp <strong>hotter</strong>, or adjust grind size <strong>coarser</strong>.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>… you have to be willing to experiment. Don’t think of it as a waste of beans. Gulping coffee without paying attention to flavor is a waste, experimentation is the best possible use of good beans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tried varying the grind size and water temperature in an AeroPress, and so far my results agree with this.</p>

<p>In particular, I've found that brewing medium roast beans with 175°F water (using a calibrated thermometer) produces coffee that's not sour, while higher temperature water often produces sour coffee (tasting a bit like vinegar). The company recommends 175°F except with light roast beans, in which case some people prefer 185°F water. See <a href=""https://aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/"" rel=""noreferrer"">their FAQ</a> about temperature.</p>

<p>I have not tried varying the brew time. The <strong>inverted method</strong> lets you increase the brew time but you can accomplish that without the mess by inserting the plunger, pulling back slightly to decrease the pressure below room pressure, then waiting.</p>

<p>You can see that the brewing variables are interdependent. That probably explains why people using the inverted method to brew longer would use hotter water to compensate for what would otherwise be over extraction. (I don't know why cooler water extracts more than hotter water.)</p>

<p>The ideal brew time, temperature, and grind size will vary with brew method. AeroPress immerses the grinds in water, thus it's relatively insensitive to grind size.</p>

<p>Origin isn't the only thing that affects taste, it's also how the bean has been processed. I took a section out of the article and posted it below for you. Hopefully this helps.</p>

<p><strong>Central America</strong>(Guatamala, Costa Rica, Honduras,Mexico, El Salvador) – Balanced; having both fruit and cocoa type characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Brazil</strong> –  Generally speaking Brazilian coffee will taste slightly like peanuts and have a lingering aftertaste.</p>

<p><strong>Colombia</strong> – Colombian coffee’s are sweet with a medium body. </p>

<p><strong>Ethiopia</strong> – The home of the Arabica Bean! There are so many different unique varieties growing here, the climate is so great for coffee that it naturally thrives in the wild.  As you can imagine, all of those varieties come with a  huge flavor range. Coffee from here can taste like anything from intense blueberry or strawberry flavors all the way to cups of coffee that taste more like a tea with lemongrass.</p>

<p><strong>Kenya</strong> – Kenyan coffee, unlike most coffee are grown mostly without shade. This, combined with the a unique processing method gives coffee from this region usually has sweet and savory characteristics. (Think tropical coffee.)</p>

<p><strong>Indonesia</strong> – Popular coffee regions from within Indonesia are Papua New Guinea and Sumatra.  Coffee beans from Papua New Guinea are usually sweet and floral while beans from Sumatra are really heavy tasting with earthy spicy tones.</p>

<p>There are three main ways of processing the coffee bean: Semi-washed, Washed, Sun-dried</p>

<p><strong>Washed</strong>(Wet Processed): This is the most popular method used around the world. Coffee processed this way are said to show the true flavor of the bean. This a very popular method in central America, This allows the beans to really show off their acidity.</p>

<p><strong>Natural</strong>(Sun-dried): Coffee processed this way will have a bigger body and lower acidity. 80% of coffee in Brazil and Ethiopia is processed this way.</p>

<p><strong>Semi-washed</strong>: This processing method combines the benefits of both natural and washed. Coffee that is processed this way will have a taste that is deep and fruity with a some what creamy mouth feel.</p>

<p>Ratio is definitely a personal preference, there is no right or wrong. I've seen people say that they like ratios of <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/3fsxmv/cold_brew_coffee_ratios/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1:8 all the way down to 1:4</a>. (ex.1:8 ratio is 5 ounces of beans to 40 ounces of water.) If you think yours is weak try a 1:4 ratio. </p>

<p>Not sure what your grind size was but if it's weak I would suggest going finer. You don't want to go to fine though and have a bunch of coffee sludge in the bottom of your pitcher because your grounds were too fine and came out of your filter. </p>

<p>If you use a medium-fine grind you should. If you need help with grind sizes <a href=""https://bettercoffeeathome.com/coffee-grind-types/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this might help you out</a>. </p>

<p>Also maybe try brewing it at room temperature, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/39tca2/coldbrewed_coffee_to_fridge_or_not_to_fridge/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a> people are talking about good results with a 12-18 hour brew time by just leaving it on the counter instead of putting it in your fridge. </p>

<p>Another thing that could be effecting your flavor is the beans you are using. You mentioned that you like Starbucks and I think they have a really bold roast flavor. Maybe the beans you're using aren't capable of giving you the flavor you're looking for. </p>

3608,2,,2017-06-20T00:52:51.683,6,,"<p>I understand that the crema created by the Brikka is an approximated crema using the gasket's small opening. Sure, purists may not consider this tan, smooth film of microbubbles as authentic crema (akin to espresso makers), but it does do a good job creating it for a close mouthfeel. </p>

<p>I use my Brikka every day, and it creates the ""Brikkrema"" (as I'd like to call it) just fine [see the photo].</p>

<p>If you aren't achieving proper results, it could be the water, or the bean you're using. I've had instances where some beans wouldn't generate a great crema, as compared to other varieties. Factors could be the age, the containers their kept in, and all basically relating to the oils and the CO2 trapped in the bean shortly after roasting.</p>

<p>The last photo shows a comparison between pours. The first pour (left) often providing the most crema from a brew, while the subsequent pours (right) may not have as much. It helps to spread the first pour over each shot if you have more than one shot to serve, and then pour the rest of the coffee along the side of the cup as not to disturb the cream on top. Sometimes, a brand new Brikka needs 3-4 brews before it begins creating its magic. But even so, if you aren't achieving your preferred result, try these tips: </p>

<ol>
<li>Try to lessen the water below the water line

<ul>
<li>start with a shot's worth of water then see what you get, then just increase to get a proportion you're happy with).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try filtered water

<ul>
<li>you'd be surprised how big a difference water quality can make.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Change the bean you're using, until you get your desired results. 

<ul>
<li>Some beans offer varying levels of crema, whether it's because of the CO2 content from the roast or just the overall nature of the bean.</li>

<p>Although a company called BRU did manufacture instant coffee's from different regions around the world specifying strengths and aromas. you might wanna take a look at that. It's called 'Bru Exotica'</p>

  <p>Besides for sanitary reasons, does the type of stirrer used effect the
  quality of the coffee? Is there an ""ideal"" stirrer material when
  preparing coffee?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Short answer yes.</p>

<p>A stirrer ought to not add any flavors to the coffee and, as a secondary concern to this question, be easy to clean.</p>

<p>Our choices are ceramic, porcelain, glass, wood / bamboo, metals (gold, silver ...) and stainless steel.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ceramic is too porous and the glazes are suspect at best as regards
health and taste.</li>
<li>Wood / bamboo will absorb coffee flavors. If the wood / bamboo stirrer is only used for coffee I don't think it will impart any noticeable flavor profiles. I have been using a chopstick for a long time and have never noticed an added flavor. As a side note on a camping trip I used a trimmed (but still fresh) spruce branch and that did impart a flavor. :)</li>
<li>Metals are suspect at best. There are numerous articles on the subject regarding aluminium, silver and other metals.</li>
<li>Stainless steel does not impart a taste and does not react with the coffee.</li>
<li>Porcelain does not impart a taste but, as with ceramics, there can be a concern about the glaze.</li>
</ul>

<p>TL/DR</p>

<p>Food safe ceramic, porcelain and stainless steel will not impart flavor.
Wood / bamboo to a very minor extent might. </p>

You also gain access to techniques of manufacture that have high- up front costs (mold or die-making, say) but low per-peice production costs.</p>

<p>The one-off custom made machine has none.</p>

<p>A unit with a small market segment/target has some, depending on the production run size - hundreds, thousands, 10's of thousands.</p>

<p>A mass-market consumer product made by the millions has many. It's not uncommon to build a whole factory or at least a line of specialized equipment for the job.</p>

<p>Then you can add in the other factors that might be deliberate reductions in quality to meet a price point, or jacking up the price to reflect a name attached to the product.</p>

<p>If you could make a ""equivalent"" machine for 1/10th the price, you'll probably have an easier time selling it at 95% of the price, at least to the market segment that expects the higher price, and you'll also make a lot more money from each sale.</p>

<p>If you were going to offer this same machine at a lower price to get more sales volume and make more money, you'd make it ""different"" simply to not rob yourself of the sales at the higher price point, since those buyers would be unlikely to consider a ""cheap"" machine worthwhile - so your marketing department would make some meaningless changes and roll it out as a budget alternative, and ""experts"" would ""taste"" a difference between them...</p>

3631,2,,2017-06-30T00:08:17.263,2,,"<p>It is certainly <em>possible</em> to avoid using a cone, and I have also done this in a pinch. Though it works, <strong>there is no real benefit to using a bare filter</strong> (that is, using a paper filter without a filter-holding cone or other device) as far as the brew/outcome is concerned (other than the obvious, trivial facts of less equipment and not having to clean the cone). There are other <em>reasons</em> to not use a cone, and there are also a few downsides.</p>

<p>The main downside is that <strong>paper filters are quite flimsy</strong>, especially certain brands and types (e.g., Hario V-cones are very thin as compared to thick, almost fabric-like Chemex). They are meant to be used with a supporting cone or basket. With support, they hold together nicely. Without support, they can easily rip, be otherwise damaged, or collapse when filled with water. The consequences are natural: contamination of brewed coffee with grounds, spilled near-boiling water, or other mess.</p>

<p>One might argue that you have better control over the speed or length of infusion, but the coffee will not drain as well or as quickly. You can precisely control the length of water/grounds contact with reasonable pouring methods. The ridges on the cone filter (like <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2013/what-purpose-have-those-grooves-inside-the-dripper"">this</a> or <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/1658/why-does-the-filtrate-sometimes-well-up-in-the-upper-cone-when-using-the-chemex/"">that</a> question) help to wick the coffee away from the filter so that it drains better. You can also find cones that have a drain plug (<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00EOM5RN0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one example</a>), so that you can steep the grounds for some time before draining, but I don't believe in that either. No matter what, I argue there's no benefit to a bare filter for this reason either.</p>

<p>That said, there are reasonable ways to use a bare filter. I sometimes use <strong>a bare filter for cold-brewing</strong> coffee without other equipment: I use a large basket-style filter (<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0006VNO7Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">arbitrary example</a>) with some grounds, then tied up with a piece of kitchen string into a small sachet like a tea bag, then submerged in a jar of water (see other <a href=""/questions/tagged/cold-brew"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cold-brew&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cold-brew</a> questions, and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/431/how-can-i-make-filtering-my-cold-brew-easier"">my problems</a> with same). However, I still have to be very careful to prevent the filter from tearing when removing it from the brewed coffee. </p>

<p>Your friend is clever and plucky for sure; however, I don't think your friend's method is going to catch on at your local coffee shop as the next fancy brew method.</p>

3632,2,,2017-06-30T00:20:20.670,2,,"<p>Your friend's method is totally valid, since coffee-brewing is only a science of extraction, not methodology.</p>

<p>In order for your friend to properly extract the coffee, he would need to go through the same process of any other brewing method. In other words, the coffee grounds should be uniform in size, the water temperature should be up to temp (the exact temperature depends on preference and on the coffee itself), the grounds should be thoroughly saturated, and extraction time should be dialed in according to the coarseness/fineness of the coffee grounds.</p>

<p>The biggest thing here is probably keeping the water up to temp, since pouring hot water into a cold mug would drastically reduce the temperature of the water. Preheating the mug, as well as covering the mug during brew-time, would help the water keep its temperature. If he's using a paper cup, then this wouldn't apply, and he could just use the lid for insulation during brew-time.</p>

<p>With all of that said, another easier way to explain myself is just to say that your friend is basically doing a filtered french-press. However, instead of doing it in a vessel created for immersion brewing, he's just using a mug.</p>

<p>Concerning your question about there being an advantage using a pour-over cone, the answer heavily depends on preference, as well as whether the brewing process is in keeping with the standards I've already mentioned. Basically, though, no. There's not really an advantage. If he likes the taste of the coffee with his teabag-like method, then he's doing it right. Could he do it better? The answer is almost always yes.</p>

<p>generally speaking, adding spices makes the coffee good for you. it is customary in eastern cultures to add cardamom to coffee and serve it on high political summits and stuff. cardamon coffee calms you down and gives you calm energy. it also quenches your thirst, as opposed to normal straight <a href=""https://keepvid.works/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">keepvid</a> coffee only making you thirstier. ginger coffee, for example, ginger coffee is well popular amongst athletes, it restores your energy after big workout, restores your inner balance. nutmeg coffee is good for male potency. black pepper coffee is great to flush toxins. it's all based on properties of spices. spiced up coffee is good for you. </p>

<p>cinnamon coffee, to return to it, i personally don't like the taste, but i drink it once in a while. it's good for you! cinnamon it counteracts negative effects of caffeine on your body. It promotes better blood flow, cleans the blood, helps with flu as good as nyquil does. there's truly a lot to cinnamon coffee. i recommend you try it, even if you hate it, - it's good for you. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want coffee to promote some health improving processes. So go
  ahead, put that coffee pot on the stove, or power on your Keurig
  machine, and make that favorite roast of yours, and while it’s boiling
  and cooking, continue reading this article – the best is yet to come.
  Below we will talk about several spices that promote health benefits
  when added to your favorite cup of jo, or even a latte or a mocha
  drink. Iced coffee can work here too, but best effects will surface in
  hot drinks, when hot water makes spices emit their beneficial
  qualities. Nevertheless, if you like or if it’s summer, you can make
  iced coffee good for you too, just make sure to add spices before
  chilling and icing your drink.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Cinnamon + coffee = forget your nyquil</strong></p>
  
  <p>Second spice to mention is cinnamon. It has stronger smell and taste
  than cardamom, so I talk about it second. Although “first” would be
  the obvious choice thanks to whole number of benefits one can reap
  from cinnamon spiked coffee. Cinnamon is truly an amazing spice.
  Adding it to coffee will help decrease the negative acidic effects
  coffee has on your body. Cinnamon cleans your blood, promotes better
  blood flow, warms you up inside and decreases inflammation. It is an
  amazing natural home-made help during cold and flu season. Yes, treat
  your cold with cinnamon coffee! Or at least try one time. You’ll see
  the difference. Ethnoscience (or maybe better – Folk Medicine) states
  and insists, that cinnamon coffee can better your mood, positively
  stimulate nervous system, improve clarity of your vision. And on top
  of all, the aroma coming from cinnamon coffee mug is simply
  indescribably good. You gotta try it! Just one little pinch of organic
  cinnamon powder and you’ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>You can't really have an universal label as each of the labels have their own standards which have to be met and various coffee farms and producers follow certain ones. For example, in the <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-hostetler/sustainable-coffee-certifications_b_1446658.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Huffington Post</a>, it mentions some of these labels:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>USADA (or simply USDA): This is basically the United States' label for organic for various products (i.e meat and fruits) that is not limited to only coffee. It is quite strict (has certification agencies, checks for criterion not only during production but also distribution and packaging) as it</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aims to promote and enhance natural soil activity and cycling of resources, which helps to create a rich and fertile substrate for the crop and maintain ecological balance by prohibiting use of artificially produced (synthetic) agrochemicals.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>As mentioned by @avacado1, there is an European equivalent to the USDA, which is the EU Organic Program (note that the EU doesn't cover all of Europe). <a href=""http://www.usda-eu.org/trade-with-the-eu/trade-agreements/us-eu-organic-arrangement/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>Some companies like Starbucks have their own labels that guarantee their standards for their coffee:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C.A.F.E. (which stands for Coffee and Farmer Equity) evaluates the economic, social, and environmental aspects of coffee production in order to ensure that Starbucks’s sources of coffee are sustainably grown. Starbucks collaborated with Scientific Certification Systems (SCS), a third-party evaluation and certification firm, to develop the guidelines for the program.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Rainforest Alliance Program: This is a more ""natural"" certification since:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With this program, coffee is grown on farms where forests, rivers, soils, and wildlife are conserved and workers are treated with respect, paid decent wages, have proper and safe equipment, and are given access to education and medical care.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Bird Friendly Conversation: This label ensures that the coffee farms support the native and migratory birds that come over for a visit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center (SMBC) gives this certification to farmers in order to promote shade-grown organic coffee plantations that can play a key role in the conservation of our global environment and of migratory birds that find sanctuary in these forest-like plantations.</p>

<p>There is no universal sustainability grade for coffee plantations that I know of.  Many times coffee comes from individual shareholders that don't own much more than a coffee 'garden', much less than a plantation.  Because of this, it is basically impossible to assign a grade to all sources of coffee.  Additionally, many coffee farms are far off the beaten track.  There's a story in the link I posted that describes the difficulty in reaching some of these coffee plantations.  Consider that most coffee is high grown, much of it between 1800 and 2000 meters in elevation.  This is pretty much up in the mountains where large cities, significant infrastructure may be lacking due to the terrain.</p>

<p>From a roasters perspective, I am able to find lots of coffee coming from farms that focus heavily on sustainability, but they are typically microlots and they are typically quite expensive.  Also as a roaster, it is to my benefit to tell the end consumer all about the farm and what they do for sustainability, because like you, a lot of individuals are interested in knowing that type of information.  I would keep an eye out for specialty roasters and just go read the informational pages on their coffees and you should be able to find coffees very quickly that come from farms that focus sustainability.</p>

<p>One other tidbit of information.. There are certain countries that regulate the export of coffee in such a way that the majority of coffees are lumped into the same lots, and you lose all traceability.  Ethiopia's ECX exchange is an example of this, and much of the Colombian coffee trade is regulated by the government.  (there are microlots coming from both these countries so this isn't an 'avoid these coffees' warning or anything ... avoid Ethiopian coffee.... the horror!)</p>

I'd never seen one before, and I'm not familiar with the machine, so I'm not sure if the design and make is proprietary. But the roaster can roast the green beans to your desired roast in nearly 2 minutes flat &amp; that is quite impressive, since you can choose from a light to dark roast gradient. I've purchased beans from a branch in the Philippines, had about 250g of Brazilian beans city-roasted (on the dark side), and must say that the result delivered a balanced flavor, without too much bitterness in the brew, creating a good bloom (pour over) &amp;/or crema (Bialetti Brikka), and a pretty good expression from the roasted bean.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask if anyone is familiar with the process of this quick-roasting style, and if there are any inherent differences that could come from this speed-roasted bean, as compared to a more traditional slow-roasted bean.</p>

3661,2,,2017-07-11T14:59:24.377,5,,"<p>Roast times can significantly affect coffee flavors, and a 2 minute roast profile is concerning.  While I cannot say I am familiar with the process they are using, I do know a decent amount about the chemistry involved when you are roasting a coffee bean.  My biggest concern would be internal development of the coffee bean.</p>

<p>To give you a brief run-down of roasting, without spending hours on this post..</p>

<p>You typically have two types of heat in roasting, conductive and convective.  There are disagreements on how best to apply heat to a coffee bean, but the traditional understanding is you apply conductive heat early in the roast and convective at the end.  The reason is because if you do not dehydrate the internal bean, you will get an insulating barrier of zero moisture encapsulating the moist interior of the bean that will result in underdeveloped flavors (sour, acidic)</p>

<p>If you apply too much convective heat early on, then this will typically happen.  If you apply too much conductive heat, you usually get what is called tipping which can be seen on the ends of beans as a small black spot where the plant would actually sprout had the bean been planted (this is a natural weak spot in the cellular structure that allows the plant to sprout).</p>

<p>To roast a coffee bean from room temp to ~400F give or take 25 degrees in 2 minutes would require an average rate of rise (RoR) of 115 degree / minute.  To give you an idea of the difference, The highest RoR I typically roast at is about 36 RoR and maybe an average RoR of 15 or 20.</p>

<p>My initial reaction to application of heat so quickly to a coffee bean would be that you would get over-roasted on the outside with possible tipping, and an under roasted interior resulting in sourness.</p>

<p>I know that timing on airbed roasters is different from traditional drum roasters, but I've never heard of them doing 2 minute roasts either so I am guessing this is a proprietary roasting system of some sort.  That being said, if you want a pretty in depth discussion on how roast times affect flavor you can check out Modulating the Flavor Profile of Coffee by Rob Hoos.  He gives a very thorough break down of what happens when you trim as little as 20 seconds off a given segment of a roast profile and how that affects the flavors in coffee.</p>

<p>(btw, if I deviate from my desired roast level by more than 45 seconds, the beans usually end up in the trash can because I refuse to sell them)</p>

On top of that, ghee has more butyrate, an anti-inflammatory fat that keeps your gut lining and metabolism in good shape. </p>

<p>Grass-fed butter and ghee are almost all fat, and they're the good, saturated fat your body and brain need to stomp out hunger and cravings, banishes brain fog, and help you <strong>lose weight</strong>, build muscle, and increase focus and performance. Having these fats in the morning jump start your brain activity and kick start your metabolism, also putting your body into a state of ketosis, which <strong>helps you burn fat</strong>!</p>

3679,2,,2017-07-19T14:32:05.903,1,,"<p>I purchased one of the Bonavita 1900 TS brewers for my Dad for his birthday, while I still use a 12 cup Cuisinart with thermal carafe at home.  We have identical grinders for home use.  What I have found is that he uses significantly less grounds to make a pot of coffee.  While I will use 8-8.5 scoops in an 8 cup pot on the cuisinart (about 7.5g per scoop) ground at very slightly finer than medium, on the Bonavita, he uses 5 scoops ground at the same level.  Personally this produces coffee a bit too thin for me, but the entire family things it is great.  When I am visiting I bump it up to closer to 6-7 scoops and it comes out good.</p>

<p>Couple things.  Bitter coffee is due to over extraction.  This could be grind level, amount of coffee being used or water temperature.  Let's presume for now that water temp is ok since it is a nearly new, high quality machine.  </p>

<p>Since you have already been working with the grind level, I would suggest you back off the amount of coffee you are using and see if that produces any positive results.  This machine definitely brews 'stronger' given the same input parameters.</p>

<p>Some posts have indicated that your grinder cannot grind coarse enough for a true coarse grind.  I'm unfortunately not familiar with your particular grinder so this also may be the case.  Regardless, if you are getting bitter coffee and you have ground as coarse as you can, then backing off the amount of grounds should net some improvement.  If you get to the point that your coffee is both thin, and bitter, then I would probably start thinking about replacing the grinder, although I hate to recommend purchasing new equipment when it appears you should already be set up for success.  </p>

My problem, like yours, was bitterness so my first step was to increase the weight of the coffee grounds to 85gms (for 8 cups) to reduce the extraction.  This helped a little but it was still bitter, so at that point I knew I had to increase the grind size. Unfortunately my Capresso Infinity grinder wouldn't go any coarser so I bought a Baratza Encore grinder, worked up to a 30 grind setting (quite coarse), and the bitterness was gone. Then I reduced the coffee weight to 80gms per Bonavita's recommendation and things are good.   </p>

<p>However, if you reckon there is too much coming through, make sure you're not using too much water relative to your total brew weight in the bloom.

3685,2,,2017-07-22T17:18:25.100,9,,"<p><strong>Attempt 1</strong></p>

<p>For the first attempt, I brewed it exactly like I brew my normal (water-based) coffee. I used a French Press with a light/medium roast, heating the milk in Pyrex in a microwave. The milk heated unevenly, curdling in places. Luckily, the curdled bits stuck to the Pyrex and I was able to make a passable cup. The thickness of the milk meant that it didn't want to pass through the mesh when pouring.</p>

<p>The predominant flavor was that of the milk. I could barely tell it was coffee, though it definitely absorbed <em>some</em> flavor. The texture was about what you'd expect--<em>very</em> smooth and rich. It was the kind of drink that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.</p>

<p><strong>Attempt 2</strong></p>

<p>From my first attempt, I learned that milk is able to absorb and mask coffee's flavor incredibly well (after all, it's what people use to tone down overly strong coffee). This time, I heated the milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently (a rather long and annoying process for a single cup of coffee). I probably could have gotten it a bit hotter, but it worked well enough. I nearly doubled the amount of grounds and brew time.</p>

<p>This time, it came out with a distinct coffee smell, and about the same texture. Again, the initial flavor was that of the milk, but it had a smooth, subtle, and quite pleasant coffee aftertaste. I never got that bad taste you sometimes get a while after a normal cup of coffee--instead, the residual flavor was like you had just taken a sip.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>I wouldn't want milk-brewed coffee for my morning cup. It feels more like a drinkable dessert.</p>

<p>If anyone else wants to try this, I recommend using some stronger/darker coffee. I didn't have any dark roast on hand, or I would have tried it. Give it time to brew--more than you would with water. Be patient when heating the milk, or you'll end up curdling it and ruining the whole thing.</p>

<p>This could probably work as a dessert drink if brewed with some spices in addition to the coffee. If nothing else, I'd say it looks pretty cool as you can see in the attached image.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I tried this again today with espresso coffee (Cafe Bustelo), and it turned out great. The end result was like a latte but more... dull, or smooth. I don't know how exactly to compare it. Espresso grind is definitely the right choice when brewing with milk--it's the only thing strong enough and with the right flavor profile to stand out in the milk and complement the milk's flavor.</p>

<p>Be warned, though, that the fine grind of espresso coffee means you will need to use a paper filter at some point along the way. Sticking a paper filter in a French Press doesn't work because of how resistant the milk is to going through the filter. It seems to jet around the sides, allowing the espresso to slip through.</p>

<p>I think there are going to be a few problems with replacing water with milk.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Since you are extracting with a liquid that already has some dissolved solids, I would guess it will not extract as well as water.  This correlates well with RogueCSDev's results in that you need a dark roast which will tend to extract more easily than a light roast.</li>
<li>You will have an issue with overheating the milk and causing curdling.  Steamed milk in espresso based drinks is usually heated to 150-160 degrees.  To heat it beyond 170 degrees is going to create burnt flavors in the milk.  Since optimal brewing temperature for coffee extraction is ~35 degrees above the burn point for milk, I don't see a way to get around this without using a cold brew type of method trading extraction time for heat.</li>
</ol>

<p>I just saw a mention of brewing espresso with milk..  For readers in the future DO NOT put milk in an espresso machine (This isn't what the writer was intending, but it is easy to misread)..  Putting milk into a boiler on an espresso machine is a sure fire way to add some weight to your trashcan, or cause significant damage.  This is the entire reason why you purge your steam wand, to prevent milk from being pulled into the boiler.  Long story short, it will cause bacterial growth inside the espresso machine inside the small components which will require a complete break-down and cleaning, something that on a small machine would cost more than replacing the machine, and on a large machine will cause long downtime and very high repair costs.</p>

<p>Every morning I'm up pretty early and will usually make myself a quick instant coffee in a travel mug and hit the road. It is <em>really</em> good instant coffee, IMHO, and not only keeps me going for most of the morning but is also very tasty. But usually just after lunch I'm hankering for another, and herein the problem lies: most of the office are tea drinkers, and the options for coffee are limited to one <em>awful</em> instant variety.</p>

<p>It wouldn't really be acceptable for me to bring in a jar of coffee (I know this would be fine in some places but I wouldn't feel comfortable with it in my workplace culture) so what I'd like to do is bring in a mix of my coffee contents to use in a one-off way.

3694,2,,2017-07-25T18:05:38.230,3,,"<p>Depends on if you want to be able to grind true espresso grinds.  My daily grinder I received as a wedding present and it suits me just fine, a Cuisinart for about $40 dollars.  If I want to grind for espresso, this is completely incapable of doing so, so I ended up getting a $180 dollar unit that is capable of timed grinding and grinding to espresso level grind.  This unit is a Breville with a cone burr, which I honestly really like because it doesn't have the static of the Cuisinart.</p>

<p>This is very much a personal choice type of question.  If you have $10000 burning a hole in your pocket, I'm sure you could find a grinder to match, or if you are worried about keeping the lights on, you could probably find one to suit your needs as well.</p>

<p>Here are a few recommendations..</p>

<p><strong>Low End:</strong>
Cuisinart DBM-8 -- Does good coarse grind, to a reasonably fine grind.  Drip brewers and pour over are right in the middle of its standard grind range.  Biggest con is it is a flat disc grinder and generates quite a bit of static so be aware that it will make a bit of a mess.  Cannot grind espresso.</p>

<p><strong>Mid Range (150-250)</strong> -- The Baratza Encore is really popular and a pretty good price.  It has conical burrs and gearing specifically intended to reduce static and heat.  I personally use a Breville Dose Control Pro which is about the least expensive grinder I could find with the portafilter holder and timed grinding.  Thus far I've been happy with it, low static, very very fine grind level for espresso if needed, but I am seeing some reviews about how the internal components tend to fail after extended use.  Someone may be able to comment on the feasibility of the Encore for espresso grind better than I.  Breville can grind espresso, someone please comment on Encore / Virtuoso espresso grind capability!</p>

<p><strong>High Range</strong> --  The sky is the limit here.  You could go with a higher end Baratza going all the way to the 1000 dollar range and probably higher, if you've got that $10,000 dollars burning a hole in your pocket you could go big with a 60 lb EK43 (and then send me a big tip!).. just kidding.  The EK43 runs about 2500 and is a shop grinder, although it is now a barista favorite for competition.  When you start getting into the super high end machines, personally my favorite is Mahlkonig but really.. there's no reason for this caliber of grinder at home.  </p>

<p>Again, how much to spend is a tricky question.  I would say a minimum of $40 and a max of however much you want to spend.  If you have the money, and want a solid reliable workhorse, I would probably go with either the Baratza Encore or Baratza Virtuoso.  Baratza is one of the higher quality, and popular home grinders that don't completely break the bank.</p>

Coffee is at its best(freshest) when you grind the coffee beans just before you make the coffee, weather it's an espresso machine or a pour over or aeropress, chemex ect. The four hours I don't know about but I do know the freshest of coffee is made when you use fresh coffee(roasted in the last 2 weeks). If you are using tap water which is fine it is best tou fill you machine the previous night, this gives the water time for the added chemicals put in the water by local Govt(fluoride etc) to evaporate. The coffee in supermarkets, esp ground coffee where you see the best before date on the bag as 2 years away, this is not fresh coffee even if it is vacume packed. Buy your coffee from a shop that shows when the beans where roasted, of course this is assuming you are making your coffee at home, a good coffee shop will know all this, look for speciality coffee shops, at least these shops know what they are doing and their mission is to produce the best tasting coffee they can.</p>

<ol>
<li>heat effects the extraction process. For most methods you are aiming for a temperature of around 200°F for a good extraction. The problem with milk is that <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Curdle-Milk"" rel=""noreferrer"">it will curdle at 180°F</a>. This doesn't allow you to get everything out of the coffee that you might like to.</li>
<li>Milk has fat in it which <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/6p0fdr/cold_brew_steeped_in_milk/"" rel=""noreferrer"">pulls out the hydrophobic compounds</a> of the coffee(the oils) a lot more quickly than water does.

3704,2,,2017-07-29T04:19:43.187,2,,"<p>To begin, the Sweethome review <a href=""http://thesweethome.com/reviews/the-best-coffee-grinder/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Best Coffee Grinder</a> is quite helpful for background and their experimental evaluation of grinders, although of course they only tested a modest number of the available grinders.</p>

<p>Sweethome says what a grinder needs to make tasty coffee is to <strong>produce consistently- and uniformly-sized coffee grounds</strong> because coffee extraction is sensitive to grind size. Uneven grounds cause uneven extraction which produces overly bitter and sour tastes. Other sources agree.</p>

<p>My (limited) experiments back this up: The Baratza Encore grinder has 40 grind size steps, step #20 (depending on the type of beans) is my favorite for a drip coffee maker. Adjusting the setting ±1 makes the coffee noticeably sour or bitter, as verified by blind tasting. So we can expect uneven grounds to make coffee that has more bitter and sour notes.</p>

<p>Sweethome and other sources explain how <strong>blade grinders</strong> produce uneven grounds including fine particles. <strong>Burr grinders</strong> produce more even grounds. Particle size distribution is not easy to measure, esp. when static electricity makes particles stick together. (If you find evidence that a particular blade grinder can produce about as even results as a good burr grinder, please point it out!)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sweethome shows that the Cuisinart DBM-8 grinder has blades around a plastic burr. And indeed, they measured the DBM-8 distribution of particle sizes to be about as broad as whatever blade grinder they used for comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Nitpicking Sweethome's review, their charts showing the distribution of ground particle sizes would be more readable and more revealing if drawn as stack charts, one stack for each grinder to compare against the other stacks. The vertical label <em>""Particle weight (in grams)""</em> really means <em>""Amount of particles (in grams)""</em> in the given particle size range. The charts would also be more readable showing grind sizes from small to large rather than backwards. You can zoom the web page and hover your mouse over the right-side labels to make its graph line stand out.</p>

<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> Are 5 measurement buckets enough to go on? Also, we're led to assume the grinder is set so that its particle-size distribution is centered in the middle of a measurement bucket. If set to center on the border between two measurement buckets, then the chart would look 1 bucket wider (out of 5) for the same actual distribution width. The main comparison chart is for a coarse grind size. Is that representative for medium and fine grind sizes?</p>

<p>With the <a href=""https://www.baratza.com/grinder/encore/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Baratza Encore</a>, 1 size step from favorite makes a tasteable difference. Baratza documents that the grinder has 40 steps from 250 to 1200 microns. Are those steps linearly spaced? Log spaced? Linear spacing would be (1200 - 250 microns) / 39 intervals = 24.4 microns/interval = 0.024mm/interval, and my favorite grind size #20 would be 0.725mm That's in the <code>&lt; 0.76 mm</code> bucket at the end of Sweethome's chart, which is fishy. Maybe the steps are not linear.</p>

<p>Either way, the distribution width is much larger than the step size. Since adjusting by 1 step matters, it suggests that we really <em>want a more uniform particle size than current grinders achieve.</em></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://aerobie.com/aeropress/faqs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AeroPress FAQ</a> gives another answer to why it's important to use a good quality grinder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A good grinder will grind coffee into particles of uniform size. Very fine particles block the flow of water and make it difficult to press. The same blocking occurs if your grinder is dull and produces particles of varying size because the fine particles block the spaces between the larger particles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The AeroPress seems to be less sensitive to grind size than drip coffee machines. Are espresso makers more sensitive to grind size than drip machines?)</p>

<p>While grind size is the main evaluation factor, there are secondary considerations like the ability to grind finely enough for your espresso machine, ease of use, how long it takes, and how loud it is.</p>

<p><strong>Sweethome's answer to your price question</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>High end: $2,700 Mahlkönig EK43 commercial-grade burr grinder.</li>
<li>Recommended: $230 Baratza Virtuoso burr grinder.</li>
<li>Second best: $130 Baratza Encore burr grinder.</li>
<li>Budget pick: $92 Capresso Infinity burr grinder.</li>
<li>Low cost fallback: $33 Hario Mini Mill Slim hand grinder.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But:</strong> These sources don't really answer the question <strong>how much to spend for your tastes?</strong> How uniform does your grind size need to be?</p>

<p>If you're not a coffee taste enthusiast, or if you add enough sugar to mask bitter and sour tastes, then you might be happy with an inexpensive blade grinder. <strong>Try doing a blind taste test comparison</strong> of bitterness and sourness for a blade grinder vs. a (hand or electric) burr grinder -- after tuning their grind-size settings.</p>

<p>For coffee taste enthusiasts, it's pretty likely that you'll want the most consistent- and uniformly-sized grounds you're willing to pay for. Of course, results that measure almost as uniform might taste the same. Again, try a blind taste test.</p>

<p>Let me add my opinion here: my 2.5 years old niece drinks regular (not decaf) Turkish coffee together with us during her daily routine. Caffeine's effects are similar in adults or in children. And they are more or less the same. However, children have smaller and more sensitive bodies. So, we let her drink really small amounts. She becomes happy to be a part of the family. I can say, everybody in our family grown up like that for generations, none of us experienced caffeine-related problems. (Still, we are not MDs and we are a very limited sample set. This is a coffee board, not a medical opinion body.)</p>

<p>I cold brew large batches to keg with nitro and also drink it straight and here are a few notes I have about my two numbers.</p>

<h1>Time:</h1>

<p>The time range everyone says is 12h-24h. I think this is about right and I think the sweet spot for normal brews is about 16h at room temperature. Closer to 24 hours can often taste ""over extracted"" and will be more bitter, but also more caffeinated. If you're trying to brew stronger, I'd try keeping your ratio the same and adjusting time to see what you want the brew to taste like first. Higher ratio brews seem to also benefit from longer steep times as solubility can become a factor, so usually if I like a coffee at 0.125 ratio for 14 hours and I go to make a 0.200 ratio brew, I'll steep it for 15-16 hours instead to make sure I can dilute it down to how I like it. This is where things tend to be by ""feel"".</p>

<h1>Ratio</h1>

<p>Ratio is much more scientific. It's just how much water and how much ground coffee you use. Protip: Use metric units and measure your ratio as Kg coffee : L water. This makes life way easier since you don't buy water by weight, but 1 Kg of water = 1 L of water, so your ratio makes sense. Here are the ratios I regularly use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>0.100</strong>: ""Beginner"" Nitro cold brew. If you want to serve a keg of cold brew and nitrogenate it, but your audience is family or non-coffee enthusiasts, this is a good ratio so that people don't chug a cup of it and feel like their eyes are going to pop out from the caffeine.</li>
<li><strong>0.110</strong>: ""The book"" cold brew: loads of people swear by ""1 gallon of water per 1lb of coffee"" ratio. That's 0.110. I rarely use it, but here it is for reference.</li>
<li><strong>0.166</strong>: Flat, everyday cold brew, fresh. I frequently make fresh cold brew overnight for myself. When I wake up it's room temperature and when it drips through a filter, it has a pleasant CO2 frothiness to it. I drink this over ice, which dilutes it close to 0.125 and if there are leftovers, I'll store them in the fridge and drink them straight later. It's a good ratio if you're not planning anything and want it to be flexible.</li>
<li><strong>0.185</strong>: Strong. When I make nitro for enthusiasts, I brew here. This is a really rich, strong flavor. The creaminess of the nitrogen makes up for the fact that it's not diluted. Make no mistake, this is very strong to drink straight.</li>
<li><strong>0.200</strong>: Concentrate for 1:1 dilution. I don't typically do water dilution. I rarely brew here, but this concentrate could work with a mix of ice and condensed milk or just cold cream.</li>
<li><strong>0.250</strong>: Strong concentrate for 1:1 or higher dilution. If I make concentrate, I make it at this ratio for 16h+. Again, I don't do water dilutions, but over ice and cream or condensed milk, this can really make a good coffee flavored beverage or save space for storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now, I like Ethiopian beans for flat cold brew. I've tried several beans for Nitro and not had one I didn't like.</p>

3720,2,,2017-07-31T13:59:14.923,5,,"<p>If the concern is solely production of great espresso, I would argue that the 'skillset' required actually consists of a single point.</p>

<ul>
<li>Palate. Being able to discern flavours and work out what is good and bad about any shot is essential in being able to improve your espresso.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a skill that you'll need to train and perfect but is the only necessary ability in making good espresso.</p>

<p>The real bulk of what makes espresso great is simply being able to control the factors and variables in making it which requires an ability to taste what is wrong with any given shot. I wouldn't say the specific factors that contribute to good espresso are skills (as skills are traits of the barista), but are simply parameters that is up to you to modify and control.</p>

<p>The parameters you need to keep in mind when making espresso are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freshness of coffee</li>
<li>Grind size of coffee particle</li>
<li>Water quality and composition</li>
<li>Brew temperature</li>
<li>Brew pressure</li>
<li>Coffee distribution in portafilter</li>
<li>Amount of coffee used per shot</li>
<li>Length of shot/Amount of water pulled/Final output volume</li>
</ul>

<p>Tamp level and pressure are things that affect the shot but aren't exactly variables you would change. These would just be things you would aim to get 'right' every time. 'Right' here means ensuring a level, horizontal bed of coffee and a consistent tamp pressure. Tamp pressure is easier to normalise than it sounds; tamp until the coffee bed stops compressing.</p>

<p>Many of the above will be down to the grinder and espresso machines chosen.</p>

<p>Having a bottomless portafilter enables a clear view of the exit of the shot which serves as an invaluable tool in recognising uneven extractions.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never tap/knock the portafilter after tamping. This completely destroys puck uniformity.</li>
<li>Use a distribution tool to help evenly distribute coffee in your portafilter. Use a pin with the Weiss Distribution Technique or a Pullman Chisel/OCD.</li>
<li>VST baskets are replacement baskets for your portafilter with filter holes positioned and sized to aid uniform extractions. Would recommend getting one.</li>
<li>Grind uniformity is also a thing to keep in mind. Higher quality grinders will result in a lower deviation in particle sizes of the resulting coffee grounds. Lower deviation means more consistency in extraction.</li>
<li>Use a scale and a timer to weigh and time your shots. You will need to know what you did in order to know how to improve it.</li>
<li>When chasing a good shot, change one variable in your method at a time. If you change multiple, you will never know what contributed to making your shot great.</li>

  <p>I just want to make good coffee and get on with my day</p>

<p>Espresso is probably the most time intensive method of brewing coffee given you have to get the machine warmed up (10-15 minutes), start pulling shots, probably make tweaks to grind level, pull time to get a solid espresso shot, steam milk if you want a mixed drink and then cleanup which can include everything from cleaning the drip tray, soaking portafilters, backflushing the machine etc.</p>

<p>I have basically every coffee brewing method in my kitchen, but espresso is only made when I am testing new blends, or if I decide I have the spare time and energy to make espresso (and deal with the cleanup).  Personally, if my only option for morning coffee before heading to work was espresso, I would be pretty grumpy because I'm not a morning person, and definitely don't want to deal with the complexity of espresso before my first sip of coffee in the morning!  I realize this is a redirect from your original question, but it may be worth investigating alternate brewing methods of regular old coffee that don't take the time commitment (and monetary commitment) that espresso does.  A better dripper, grinder, go pour over, or french press maybe.</p>

<p>If instead, your perfect morning cup is espresso or nothing, and you are prepared to spend the time it takes to make it well, then the skill set is not to difficult to learn.  In my opinion patience is key.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Timing - Timing is everything in espresso.  Basically, you are configuring your grinder, and the pressure you apply during the tamp such that when you apply water pressure to the portafilter you will get an estimated 2 fl oz of extracted fluid inside 25-30 seconds.  Skills here are really deductive reasoning and tamping.  A big part of timing is understanding how each step in making espresso affects timing.  If you pull a 35 second shot, either your tamp was light, or your grind too coarse.  Dialing in a shot is basically getting into this time range, then tasting, and then adjusting to optimize flavor.  You might pull a 30 second shot that you fell like tastes sour.  If so, adjusting to 28 or 25 seconds might improve flavor.</li>
<li>The Tamp -- consistency is everything here, and this is probably the most technically difficult portion of pulling good espresso in my opinion.  Everything else is just making sure the numbers line up.</li>
<li>Steaming Milk -- There is a definite technique to this that you are not going to simply be able to read and repeat.  You can get reasonably steamed milk without any experience but if you want milk with micro-foam that you can do latte art etc. with, then this is going to take some time with a milk pitcher in hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 100 other details to keep track of with espresso including bean quality, bean age, water quality, group head pressure among many others, but in terms of skills, the list above along with deductive reasoning and the ability to operate a timer is about all it takes in terms of skills.  The deductive reasoning bit is probably the linchpin, but really it is simply understanding what is going on under the hood so to speak..</p>

<p>Don't completely exclude mail order!!  I am based in Broken Arrow, OK but we roast our beans to order and so if you were to order coffee from my company, you would have it in your hands maybe 4-5 days after roasting which very well could be better than you might get at a local roastery.  We pride ourselves on freshness and quality so will throw away or donate coffee that has sat on the shelf for any appreciable period of time.  I am sure that we are not the only company that is this dedicated to freshness.  In addition, most roasterys have to give some sort of free shipping in order to compete in the online market space so depending on the size of your order, it very well may not cost more per pound than a local roastery.  My profile should have a link to my website if you are so inclined as to take a look around.  I typically don't link, but figured it is a direct solution to the question so it makes sense.</p>

<p>Last little thought.. my company started with me being in a very similar situation to you.  I wanted fresh premium coffee, and wanted to try a lot of different options.  This led me to home roasting.  This may be another option for you, but it is definitely a time and money commitment.</p>

3724,2,,2017-07-31T19:36:58.623,2,,"<p>The only way to verify that claim is by your own senses: flavour and taste in the cup. these are both very subjective, I might be a superficial espresso drinker but for me some good fresh ground beans last at least 3 days if kept sealed and in the fridge.</p>

<p>Ground Coffee has the tendency to absorb every oder odor in the fridge or wherever is kept (in fact one of last uses of stale or unused coffee is has a natural odor eater), so the way it is sealed is very important. Majority of ground coffee seller (Lavazza, Segafreddo, etc.) they vacuum the pack removing almost all the air (check the pack should be hard as a rock before you buy it otherwise the sealing is gone), they claim coffee will stay good even for years - again, it all comes down to what you do with it: if it is moka brew I have had it all my life and most of the times is acceptable, for espresso it is not even ground properly so I never tried.</p>

<p>The only exception to this is Illi sealing, which is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_atmosphere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">packed in nitrogen modified atmosphere</a> I find this ground coffee to be one of the best so far, when you open the pack your do feel the same aroma of fresh ground coffee, I wish they would sell it in an espresso grinding setting (I know it is difficult) to see how it would come out. I regularly buy the decaffeinated version which is ground finer and which I use to make the once-in-a-while-decaf with my oscar.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Last month I started freezing (deep freezing, at least -20) ground coffee inside sealed jars, the result is amazing: </p>

<p>There is no ""stale"" odor when you open the jar after a week or so: actually no flavor at all, I was expecting it to aggregate into bigger chunks or to develop some kind compactness but no, it is thin as it used to be;<br>
The magic happens when you put it inside a warmed up portafilter, just before pulling the shot: you can feel everything is coming back to life and the espresso is just as it used to be: visually the crema is the same, taste-wise it seems there is more acidity, but I could be wrong and it could be happening only with this variety of beans (100% arabica, almost medium roast) </p>

3726,1,3727,2017-08-01T14:50:44.540,8,1373,"<p>For the last ten years or so, I think, pour-over coffee has been very trendy (and, usually, expensive). You often see these filter racks in coffee shops:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXFyc.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXFyc.jpg"" alt=""restaurant Melitta rack""></a></p>

<p>As far as I can tell this is identical to the coffee brewing method I grew up with: the plastic Melitta cone.</p>

<p>We were not really fancy coffee people. The cones were quick and easy (and storable in a cupboard, unlike a coffee machine). The coffee was tasty. For that matter, I still use a Melitta cone when I go camping. So my question is: <em>why did pour-over coffee become such a big deal?</em> Is it just that the barista is making you a bespoke cup from scratch instead of pouring it from the urn? Or has there been some advancement in the state of the art in the last thirty years?</p>
",4595,2017-08-04T07:51:39.217,What's the big deal about pour-over coffee?,<pour-over>,2,0,1,CC BY-SA 3.0,,,,,,,
3727,2,,2017-08-01T15:27:16.710,11,,"<p>Pour over systems give you the ability to control the water flow through the coffee grounds with a high level of precision whereas a drip brewer does not.  </p>

<p>I will admit, this is a bit of a trend, but there are very real differences in the taste of a pour over versus a drip brewed cup of coffee.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blooming -- Gets rid of trapped Co2.  Easy to do in a pour over, whereas in a drip brewer, I don't believe the grounds are allowed to bloom.  If you don't let the Co2 offgas, you get metallic flavors in the cup.  Typically not really a problem since the majority of the gas is gone inside 12-24 hours anyways, but pour over allows you to completely optimize this.</li>
<li>Cleanliness of cup -- pour overs are known for producing a very clean cup of coffee, that allows you to highlight the top notes in a coffee like florals or fruit flavors.  This is the polar opposite from French Press, and drip brewers either use paper filters that aren't pre-soaked so may relay a papery flavor to the coffee, or use a metal filter which will allow quite a bit more coffee oil through the filter and thus muddy the cup (slightly).</li>
<li>Grounds saturation -- Typically drip brewers don't have a very good spray head in the drip brewer, so many times you can get a filter of grounds where the center is indented after brewing and the outer grounds may not even be wet in some cases.  Obviously, grounds not wet is a bad thing.  The indentation is also a bad thing.  It basically means that more water is being passed through the center of the filter than elsewhere which means you don't get even extraction.</li>
<li>Timing -- You don't want to pass water through the grounds too fast, nor too slow.  The reasoning for this is variable solubility rates of different compounds in the coffee.  Case in point, if you grind really coarse and 'brew' your coffee in 1 minute, what's going to happen is the citric and malic acids in the coffee grounds will extract very easily and the other more complex flavor compounds will stay in the ground.  This is going to produce a sour cup of coffee.  Pour over allows you to make minute adjustments to ground saturation timing that can produce some wild flavors in a cup of coffee.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this being said.. I still use a drip brewer for my morning cup of coffee because I'm usually running out the front door trying to get to work.  Does my drip brewer produce a good cup of coffee?  Absolutely.  Can I get a better cup of coffee with a pour over?  Probably.  It's simply a quality / time trade off.</p>

3730,2,,2017-08-04T07:51:39.217,8,,"<p>Nate sums up the technical aspects nicely in his answer (+1!), so I'll just add a few other aspects.</p>

<p>You also asked for the difference between the pour-over today and back then and where the difference to getting a cup from the big batch urn was.</p>

<p>As far as the big urn goes, it is a question of timing. At the ""single serve pour-over"" coffee shop your cup will be brewed right before you get it. The longer brewed coffee stands, the more chemical reactions can happen that can produce unwanted flavours. If kept warm in a thermos container, this effect is even more noticeable. </p>

<p>Along the same lines, the time between grinding the beans and brewing them plays a role in keeping as many of the desired aromatic compounds in your drink - widely discussed on the net and also <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3715/how-quickly-does-coffee-get-stale"">on the site</a>. I strongly assume that a coffee shop with the pour-over setup from your question would also grind the beans for every serving. </p>

<p>Which leads to the very interesting conclusion that (from the point of view of a coffee aficionado) the pour-over of our Grannies, who hand-cranked their coffee mill every morning and brewed by hand is actually pretty similar to the latest trend of pour-over coffee bars. The latter might be putting more effort than ever into selecting the ""best"" beans and roast, measuring water temperature and extraction times, but compared to dumping pre-ground coffee (aka coffee-flavored sawdust) in a huge machine and keeping the sludge warm for hours, the old and the retro method are pretty much the same.</p>

<p>The big deal of the new pour-over trend is probably that many consumers have come to appreciate the finer aspects of coffee - not unlike wine aficionados. </p>

3731,2,,2017-08-04T15:22:22.680,1,,"<p>Note:  I'm not a doctor, information below is based on the fact that I've done a lot of supplementation for working out, and have done a good amount of research into those supplements.  I would recommend following the advise of a doctor before anything I say, and fact check anything you read!</p>

<p>Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor.  In general, nervous tension / anxiety has a side effect/symptom/cause of high blood pressure.  Couple high blood pressure with a drug that makes your blood vessels more narrow, and you have even higher blood pressure.  While under normal circumstances, caffeine might slightly elevate blood pressure, if you are already in a situation where it is high, it may cause more serious issues.  In addition to this, caffeine does increase energy, makes you more jittery.. essentially increases tension!  So long story short, removing caffeine may reduce symptoms of your tension, and may also net you positive health benefits from removing it.</p>

<p>As for how to get off caffeine.  Personally, I do this whenever I start working out in the gym and treat caffeine consumption as a cycling supplement.  This basically retains the affects of the drug without your system becoming too used to it.  It isn't very easy, but typically I stop drinking coffee completely, and when I start to get a headache, I have a 'cheat' meal and a cup of coffee.  Cheat meal meaning something reasonably high in fat.  What I've found is when I get a headache, many times a heavy dose of fat / carbs / protein can correct it very quickly.  What you will find when doing this is that you are providing an optimal condition to recover from the caffeine headache, but your body will quickly become used to not having caffeine so the headaches will go away in about a week.  That week is no fun at all, but you have to step back and think.. it's only 7 days.   </p>

<p>Lastly, your ask about safe levels of caffeine.  This is basically impossible to determine based on the fact that 'safe levels' is entirely dependent on the individual.  Unfortunately, we probably need to refer you back to your doctor on this.  Ask questions of him!  Why no caffeine?  He may have a specific reason for it.  I won't go so far as to make a recommendation other than follow your doctors advice.</p>

3732,2,,2017-08-07T16:05:01.757,1,,"<p>The difference is in the milk.  A Cafe Au Lait is a strong coffee base, with steamed milk.  This is different from a caffe latte in that it is strong coffee, not espresso.</p>

<p>Iced Cafe Au Lait has a variety of recipes from my cursory google search, but all involve some method of milk frothing.  Typically not so much as to actually make foam, but enough to incorporate some air into the milk.  Thus far, I've seen light steaming, adding milk to a french press and essentially churning it to incorporate air etc.  With a cup full of ice, and half full of iced coffee, the frothed milk is added and blended quickly.  I think the trick would be brewing a strong enough coffee that it stands up to both the milk added, as well as the ice melt, but given the coffee is pre-iced, and there is a lot of ice in the cup, and the milk isn't fully heated, it probably brings the temp down with a minimal amount of ice melt.</p>

<p>If you are adding milk to your iced coffee, most likely, it is simply milk being added without going through the added work of frothing it.  This most likely accounts for the difference in flavor.  Another question to ask is if it is the same coffee beans and brewing method for the coffee in each instance.  The cafe may prefer a different roast profile or brewing method for coffee going into their Cafe Au Lait drinks rather than their iced coffee drinks (or a cold brew base.. hrm.. might be interesting!)</p>

3736,2,,2017-08-09T20:10:26.320,1,,"<p>There is no direct relationship between the names you mention and a roast level.  That being said, once you learn the characteristics of the origin beans, then many times those beans have a particular roast level that highlights particular flavors.</p>

<p>You are correct that the names mentioned are referring to regions.  Typically these regions have an overarching 'profile' that helps guide the customer to what they want.</p>

<p>Let's take the Ethiopia Yirgacheffe for example.  Yirg's tend to have citric acidity, with berry and floral notes.  While Yirg's are roasted to all different roast levels, many times roasters will tune the roast profile to highlight the positive characteristics of the bean.  Meaning, I would bet that a large percentage of Yirgacheffes are sold at a light to medium roast level to highlight the clean cup, and lighter more delicate flavors in the cup. </p>

<p><strong>This is by no means a hard and fast rule!!</strong>  Some coffees at light roasts highlight lighter fruits like pear, apple etc, and at darker roasts that flavor switches to a deeper development of stone fruit (apricot, plum, peach) or maybe a darker roast starts to bring out baking spice type flavors.  This means that certain beans might be offered in a light and a dark variant because they both have very positive traits on both ends of the roasting spectrum.</p>

<p>When I pick a particular coffee, I never look for a 'light', 'Medium' or 'Dark' coffee.  Instead, I look for a coffee whose inherent traits align with my taste buds.  For me, I know that I will probably like a Guatemala Huehuetenango or an Ethiopia Yirgacheffe coffee provided it is a high quality bean and roasted using a good method.  A Sumatran coffee on the other hand tends to highlight very bold earthy flavors that I only prefer in certain circumstances (like when it is blended with something to balance it out) and so if someone is trying to sell me a single origin Sumatra (which isn't very common) I would probably pass. </p>

<p>If you are trying to find out how the names correlate to what flavors, I would look at the product descriptions of various specialty roasteries online.  Typically a roastery is going to have cupping notes describing the coffee and you can, in general, get a feel for what origins correlate to what flavors by just reading.  </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Look for keywords Natural and Washed when shopping coffee origins.  A Natural Ethiopia Yirgacheffe has wildly different flavors than a Washed from the same origin (even the same farm).  Naturals use a dry processing method that essentially allows the fruit to dry onto the beans (and ferment while its drying) which imparts very fruit forward flavors.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of naturals since along with the added fruitiness, they also tend to get some funky flavors that I can't exactly describe.. basically flavors of fermentation. </p>

3739,2,,2017-08-10T08:22:24.670,2,,"<p>In the scenario given, you don't have the prefect solution to drink fresh coffee. However, I would opt for carrying a brewing solution (French-press in your case) with me. Let's discuss the two cases separately.</p>

<p><strong>1. Early-brewing</strong></p>

<p>In that case, you can grind fresh beans and prepare your coffee optimally with the brewing method of your preference. However, you cannot protect the brewed cup of coffee to go 'bad'. The reason is, whatever you do, you leave tiny coffee grounds in the water and they continue the extraction process. By time, your coffee gets bitter as a result of over-extraction.</p>

<p>Actually, this is a problem even in our daily routine. Pour-over brewing methods are invented for that. We mostly use paper filters to filter out most of the tiny grounds and have a clean cup to get rid of continuing extraction. Thus, we can have a stable cup while we drink in the next five minutes.</p>

<p>If you follow your taste buds, you can clearly feel this in a Turkish coffee cup or French-press, as most of the tiny grounds are still in the final cup in a French-press (and all of them are still there in a Turkish fincan) you should be quick to drink it. Otherwise, the cup goes crap. (By the way, inverted French-press is can also be used to minimize the effect of tiny grounds. But not effective enough.)</p>

<p><strong>2. Late-brewing</strong></p>

<p>Everybody on this board could admit that after grinding coffee goes stale in a few minutes. (See <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3715/how-quickly-does-coffee-get-stale"">How quickly does coffee get stale?</a>)</p>

<p>When you grind the beans, the surface area increases so the delicious aromatics evaporate more easily. You probably will end up with a duller coffee experience at the end. However, I feel like over-extraction is a far worse problem in your case.</p>

<p>Roughly 85-90% of carbon dioxide contained in a coffee bean after roasting will be released in the first 24 hours.

The answer is really that there is no clear answer because it is a question of nomenclature and there is no 'technical' definition of 'latte' in this context that I know of. What you are really asking is what is the best option or something like that? It seems to be a feature of language that people think of terms and words in relation to what they consider ideal or 'normal' cases, other factors cause terminology to vary widely and there is no Academie francais or ISO body to pronounce on this one. Even if there was usages would still vary as Academies and language mavens everywhere eventually learn. Ingredients or components often become names for foodstuffs or well used items, 'latte' being the best example, ""chili"" another, ""canvas"" on sailing ships yet another. </p>

<p>Nomenclature regarding coffee in my extensive experience varies widely but is often taken very seriously 'locally' you might say. So it depends where you are, even then there is not agreement. In London for example experienced Italian Barristas disagreed with local coffee shop owners: whose opinion do you take?

<p>Acidity is always tricky when you talk coffee because there are differences between perceived acidity and actual acidity.  Most coffees are slightly more acidic than milk, and they are in a very tight pH range.  When I talk to customers and try to describe acidity, I typically describe a spectrum where on one end, you have acidity, and the other end you have bitterness.  </p>

<p>If you use identical beans, you will typically get the exact same amount of acids in your cup of coffee.  These acids are primarily Citric and Malic acids and they extract at relatively low temperatures compared to the other compounds in coffee which is to say, you can't use water temperature to change acid extraction without brewing at such a low temperature as to basically not brew coffee.  The caveat to that is cold brew methods which essentially trade heat for time and are known for being very low acidity.</p>

<p>You mention better flavor and less bitterness in your espresso.  This indicates to me that rather than being concerned about acid extraction, we need to look on the other end of the spectrum and look at over extraction.  If you think about a coffee ground like a sponge filled with flavors, the first thing to come out is the acids.  This is why when you brew weak coffee it is thin, and tastes acidic.  The longer you squeeze the sponge so to speak, the more compounds come out, the last being the melanoidins that contribute body to the coffee.  Just like too much acid in weak coffee, if you extract too much out of the ground you will start getting bitter flavors.</p>

<p>The first thing is determining if the flavor defect is in fact acidity, or bitterness.  The biggest identifier for me is if it is overbearing acidity, I can feel it on the sides of my tongue (that's the sour receptors).  If instead you are dealing with bitterness, or charry flavor that is going to require the exact opposite to fix it.</p>

<p>Here is a post where I was troubleshooting a particularly difficult espresso shot that gives a lot of the detailed mechanics of how to pull a shot, and what might be going wrong.  <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3518/what-is-going-wrong-with-this-espresso-shot"">Coffee SE Espresso Thread</a></p>

<p>Lets say your problem is bitter espresso shots.  The first thing to check is if your beans are overroasted.  Presuming your input beans are good, and presuming the machine is functioning as intended.. let's go through how to troubleshoot.  Bitterness means overextraction which could be caused by a large number of factors, the top being too many grounds, coffee ground too fine, tamp technique, or even inserting the portafilter into the machine too early.  First thing is first, time your shot.  You should get roughly 2 fl oz of extract (2 shot glasses) in between 25-30 seconds.  Is it taking longer than this?  If so, this could be contributing to bitterness.  To remedy, reduce the amount of grounds in your portafilter, or grinder more coarse, both of which will speed up the extraction.  An additional complication, is if you tamp the grounds using too heavy a tamp, you can cause the extraction to run slow.  </p>

<p>On the flip side, if you decide the espresso is too acidic, you do exactly the opposite, namely, tighten the grind, make sure you are applying enough pressure during the tamp, or even add a gram or two of grounds.</p>

<p>This is a reasonably simplified solution to troubleshooting espresso, but I hope it gives some insight into acidity vs bitterness, how to begin troubleshooting espresso shots etc.</p>

<p>If we decide to compare the moka pot (instead of a percolator) with espresso, then my answer is as follows. I keep the first version for history.</p>

<hr>

<p>First, the grind size is very different. It is advised that ideal grind size for espresso is around <strong>300 µ</strong> where for a moka pot it is around <strong>800 µ</strong>.</p>

<p>It is also known that espresso brews are the most acidic cups and moka pots are produce generally bitter cups. A reference to espresso brews is below, unfortunately, this study does not include moka pots.</p>

</ul>

<p>According to this knowledge, you may decide your beans and roast as you please.</p>

<p>For the roast, it is known that acidity reduces when roast degree increases. That's why many espresso brews are prepared with darker roasts. You may search for your taste.</p>

<p>For the bean origin (or the blend) you may again search for the specific acidity and bitterness. JayCo's previous study below is a good starting point again.</p>

3777,2,,2017-09-06T07:07:51.477,3,,"<p>I am a big fan of ignoring <em>volumetric</em> measures and using <em>weight</em> instead.</p>

<p>Especially for a huge pot like this one, any old kitchen scale should be precise enough to allow a good dosage (for just a cup or two, you need more precision). The general recommendation for filter coffee is </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>60g coffee per 1000g water </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(And remember that 1000g =1kg = 1l.)</p>

<p>As for the ""bath water territory"", I admit that I have gone down to ""1 heaping teaspoon per mug"", which translates to ca. 7g per 200-220g or 30-35g per 1000g. That's pretty close to what aficionados call ""bath water"", but I'm sometimes a whimp when it comes to filter coffee. 
If you are dealing with the average crowd of American (weak) coffee drinkers (sorry for bashing the cliche here), I think you can easily go down to 50g/l or even slightly below without the majority even noticing. </p>

<p>But as you are working with a small local roaster, I suggest you get a small sample beforehand and run a little test. Note that his coffee might (should!) brew differently from the supermarket sawdust. You might want to choose the right roast if you're going to lower the ratio. Tlk to your roaster: Factors that should be kept in mind are the type of machine and the fact that the water will probably be very hot, so the selected roast should be able to withstand it somewhat.</p>

<p>Also, the grind will be important, but ""medium"" should be a good starting point. If your machine needs coarser grounds, you will have to increase the coffee by 5-10% to get the same result.</p>

<p>Finally, even if you did some test runs at home and think you perfected every parameter, that kind of machine you will be using is not designed to maximize the coffee quality, but the output - that's just how it is. The results should still be significantly better than ""get a few cans of [you know which brands] and boil them to death with chlorinated water"". Most of your guests will enjoy the fête and the community and pay only little attention to the coffee - they will taste your effort and appreciate your dedication nevertheless.</p>

<p>(And if you do all that to make sure <em>you</em> can have a decent cup of coffee at the festival, I still think that's worth it!)</p>

3778,2,,2017-09-06T11:29:48.700,3,,"<p>Actually, this answer will eventually boil down to the forecasting of time dependent expected coffee consumption function of your guests.</p>

<p>You may expect that, right after a meal or right after they are seated people tend to drink coffee all together at once. Therefore, it is better to keep most (all?) of the pots filled up when you encounter them at first.</p>

<p>Then, the servers may check the pots and replace the most crowded tables' pots with empty tables' pots for a while. During that time, you may prepare your second tank of coffee brew.</p>

<p>To keep the coffee fresh, you may preheat the water, I assume. I'm not sure if your percolators are compatible but you may just heat up the water in the big one. Then use the smaller ones to brew smaller batches of coffee to keep rather fresher and smaller batches of coffee. Also, if some of the coffee remains, it is clear that a smaller batch will cost you less.</p>

<p>Besides, for serving decaf, my approach would be something like that: I would keep a few of the servers busy with serving decaf around the less crowded tables and only leave decaf pots in the most crowded tables. (Assuming that decaf will be consumed less.)</p>

<p>All and all, all of the above is my humble opinion.</p>

3779,2,,2017-09-06T13:47:16.523,1,,"<p>It could be a combination of things.  I often notice a ""fishy"" smell from any coffee I consider roasted too dark.  While the taste is generally fine, I find the smell off putting and it is one of the reasons I tend not to drink darkly roasted coffee.  It's possible that the particular roast and beans the manufacturer is using just has an unusual smell profile.</p>

<p>Freeze drying coffee (theoretically) removes all the moisture from it.  Even roasted coffee has some moisture left in it, so the scent profile of freeze dried vs regular coffee should be different.  </p>

<p>It's also possible the packager is putting some gas into the containers at the time of sealing.  If you have gone to all the trouble of freeze drying, it's important to not put moisture back in the product, and even regular humidity in a room can do that.  Do you notice the smell just when the package is opened?  Or does it persist after you have had the can opened for a day or so?</p>

<p>I ask this because not all pour-over filters are created equal, and some work better than others. </p>

<p>Factors do include:</p>

<p>a. filter shape (flat-bottom, conical, combination of the two), b. filter media (steel, paper, cloth), and;
c. grind size of the grounded beans.</p>

<p>Usually, when it comes to drip speed, you can just adjust with grind size, try to match it to filter type, follow a decent technique in water pouring to agitate the grounds, and you'll be fine.</p>

<p>But is the purity of this method best left to water and gravity? Or has anyone ever stirred the coffee slush at any point during the brew process to favorable results? </p>

<p>I'm open to any answer really. I would very much like to hear answers from a practical standpoint (i.e. Will stirring make the coffee brew faster? Taste differently?), as well from a theoretical standpoint that Illustrates the pour-over for what it is meant to be, as a zen-like, artisanal experience. </p>

<p>I do enjoy the process very much, so I'm really just curious if stirring has ever been a part of it.</p>

3782,2,,2017-09-07T07:05:27.140,5,,"<p>The short answer is yes you can stir pour overs and it can be useful but generally not recommended. </p>

<p>The primary use for stirring pour overs that I have seen is a very light stir to jostle grounds that have stuck to the brewing methods walls. The slight stir at the maximum volume of water in the filter makes sure that as fluid drains grounds stay in the slurry of water and are evenly extracted.</p>

<p>I think the biggest problem with the idea of stirring the slurry would simply be that gravity doesn't take a break when you stir.  What I mean by this is that when you agitate the grounds, you are providing the water a more effective method of traveling through the grounds because you are temporarily breaking up the coffee mass.</p>

<p>Backing off and just looking at brewing methods in general, the only brewing methods that employ stirring to my knowledge, also do not use a drip type of method for brewing.  For instance, you can stir french press after the bloom but there is no risk of the water slipping through the brewing apparatus since it is fully contained for 4-5 minutes.</p>

<p>In total, I think that stirring pour over would most likely produce inconsistent results and would run the risk of brewing weak / acidic, although it would most likely speed up brew time.  </p>

3788,2,,2017-09-08T20:04:32.390,1,,"<p>You would bloom a large percolator the same way you would bloom in a pour over. Of course, there are different ideas about how to bloom for pour over.</p>
<p>From the website <a href=""https://handground.com/grind/47-tips-to-make-pour-over-coffee-like-a-barista"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hand Ground</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a 1:1 coffee-to-water ratio for the bloom</p>
<p>&quot;Bloom the heck out of the coffee&quot; with a 2:1 ratio</p>
<p>Stir the bloom</p>
<p>DON’T stir the bloom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To bloom coffee in your percolator go through your normal routine except you will be adding less water. If you are using a 1:1 bloom subtract the mass of the coffee from the water you add to the reservoir. If you are using a 2:1 bloom, subtract twice the mass. Once you've added the coffee you will bloom it by pouring hot water evenly over the grounds. Because a percolator won't fit nicely on many scales, measure out your hot water first; this is probably easiest achieved by pouring into a pitcher on a scale until you've attained the equivalent mass of the coffee (or double). After pouring into the grounds, wait a minute. If you want to stir, stir. This might be a good idea because you are working with much more coffee than a standard pour over.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>pressurized:</strong> This type is mostly smaller in diameter (52 mm) and made partly from plastic material. As the diameter is smaller, keeping the pressure is easier even if the tamping is not even, grounds are not homogeneous in size. Thus, this is why this is the most common portafilter for entry-level home machines. It hides the irregularities. An example photo from Wikipedia is below.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>regular:</strong> This type is mostly made from pure metal and larger in diameter (58 mm). Thus, their heat retention is greater. This makes temperature equally distributed. This type is more sensible to tamping errors or grinding irregularities. But, this may be a good thing actually if you are looking for the perfect cup. Here is a photo I copied from La Marzocco website.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>naked:</strong> This type does not have the bottom spouts. This is very good if you want to see what's going on inside the portafilter. E.g. if you have problems in tamping, you can see if one side is flooding rapidly than the other side. Very good for education. Also, very nice for photographers.

<p>Assuming that the only variable here is basket diameter:</p>

<p>Scientifically, pressure applied is normally measured as force per unit surface area. Taking the bed of coffee as a flat surface, and we assume traditional extraction pressure of 8 bar, the net extraction force upon the coffee puck will be greater for larger surfaces.</p>

<p>8 bar = 800kPa = 800 kN/m<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Now given two different basket sizes 58mm and 52mm which are 0.058m and 0.052m respectively, the net force on the surface of bed of coffee will be:</p>

<p><strong>For 58mm:</strong></p>

<p>Surface area: πr<sup>2</sup> = π*0.029<sup>2</sup> = 0.00264207942</p>

<p>Net force on area: pressure x area = 800*0.00264 = 2.11 kN</p>

<p><strong>For 52mm:</strong></p>

<p>Surface area: πr<sup>2</sup> = π*0.026<sup>2</sup> = 0.00212371663</p>

<p>Net force on area: pressure x area = 800*0.00212 = 1.7 kN</p>

<p>We can see that the larger portafilter is subject to a higher force of extraction with the same pressure. What this amounts to in practice is very much dependent on your setup. However it should tend towards better consistency in extraction. This is because, for a given dose, more of the coffee is in contact with the water at the bed surface and so has a more direct pressure gradient through the puck as it will be comparatively thin in the larger basket helping to reduce probability of channeling.</p>

<p>However, observable effects in practice will be slight to none as many other variables will take precedence in affecting shot flavour and the difference in extraction force will be accounted for silently in your dial-in process.</p>

3809,2,,2017-10-05T13:16:56.940,1,,"<p>I have used metal filters similar to the linked model; however, a more correct statement would be</p>

<p>""taste all the flavors the coffee grinds have to offer""</p>

<p>This is both good and bad.</p>

<p>Metal filters are good in the sense that they allow you to experience a greater majority of the flavors that any coffee variety can offer (except for the Turkish grind coffee that will seep through the pores). This is particularly useful for Robusta coffee beans, where the flavor resides within the oils that would be trapped by the paper filters. </p>

<p>The downside is that metal filters allow you to taste even the un-pleasant(?) flavors too (I would probably be shamed for using that term). In a nutshell, I can say that paper filters are more forgiving than metal filters. If you make a modification or mistake in your coffee making process, it will be easier to taste the difference with metal filters compared to paper filters. i.e. if you use a metal burr vs. a ceramic burr you can taste the heat generated through the grinding process (if you're grinding >50g), or to a lesser extent if you pour 98-100°C water you may be able to taste it too.</p>

<p>My experience with paper filters have been positive, as I have primarily used off the shelf paper filters for my everyday cup of Joe, and Chemex filters for my fancy pants coffee (Chemex filters are thicker). While you will not be able to taste all the flavors when brewing with paper filters, you will still experience it through the aroma. A good example is to brew Italian coffee, which are generally more acidic, through a paper filter.</p>

<p>I've recently got myself a 6 cup moka pot - the smallest one we had in a local store. Doing it by instruction gets me a full pot of something in the middle between filter coffee and machine espresso. A bit watery to my taste. I like it stronger. So I use hot water and cut the extraction short - as soon as it starts bubbling - pot gets cooled. Like that I end up with about 1.5-2 cups of espresso with a stronger taste just a tiny bit bitter, just the way I like it. A bit wasteful though. </p>

<p>Then I bought a 1 cup pot, which is much smaller. The extraction process runs smoothly and ends up quicker. The bubbling phase is very short and happens at the very end. It doesn't dilute the result much. I get exactly 1 cup. The taste is just a bit weaker than what I get from the 6 cup one.</p>

I do not do anything different in my brewing between home and work, but the coffee at home is hundreds of times better.</p>

<p>Let's start off with the basics... Equipment: We have a Bonavita BV1900TS at home and the older Bonavita BV1800TS at work. I have the all-stainless-steel carafe up here at work and use Melitta #4 bleached filters because of the different filter cone shape on the 1800 model, whereas at home I have (or had until it broke) the glass-lined carafe and Bunn bleached standard-size filters.</p>

<p>Now about supplies: I'm using whole-bean coffee that I've roasted, which is never more than two weeks old. The coffee is really good. When I do a Clever at home, it tastes as that served in a really good coffee shop with baristas who know what they're doing. My water is always Ozarka Spring Water. It's world's better than Brita-filtered tap and seems to be the best of the spring waters available in this area without spending a ton of money. And, again, it makes for great coffee at home.</p>

<p>Making coffee: I grind my coffee just before brewing at a drip grind size and use somewhere in the neighborhood of 10g per cup. I rinse both filters under water for 15 seconds or more and shake dry. We have no hot water at work currently, so I rinse under cold. Now I had the coffee to the filter basket and fill the reservoir with spring water. Last step, I turn the machine on.</p>

<p>So at home, the coffee I get out is exquisite. At work, it tastes like I'm licking a cup of hot postage stamps. What is happening?! Please help!</p>

<p>Now, FAT TOM is actually an acronym for the six factors that influence the growth of microbes. And bacterial growth is what causes food to turn bad in two senses, namely <em>gross</em> and <em>dangerous</em>, although the two often go hand in hand.</p>

<p>The factors are:<br>
<strong>F</strong>ood<br>
<strong>A</strong>cidity<br>
<strong>T</strong>ime<br>
<strong>T</strong>emperature<br>
<strong>O</strong>xygen<br>
<strong>M</strong>oisture</p>

<p>In theory it's sufficient to eliminate just <em>one</em> factor to prevent spoilage, but in practical applications, it's often a combination of a few. </p>

<p>So for your coffee, the main factors are <em>moisture, food and time</em>.</p>

<p>For your Nescafé, the granules are dry, have very little ""food"" for pathogens (proteins are a real problem, for example) and are around or slightly past the best-before date<sup>1</sup>. If you say the coffe still tastes fine, I see no reason to suspect it to be unsafe.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about the second product, but will for now assume it's some kind of ""cappuchino mix"" that includes dry milk or another kind of creamer. My conclusion is largely the same as for the Nescafé product, but with a higher protein (""food"") and possibly fat content. So you have a slightly higher risk of ""spoilage"", but it's not really about food safety, just rancidity and development of ""off"" flavours.</p>

<p>So to sum it up:
If your instant coffee still tastes fine, dissolves as it should and was stored in reasonable conditions (dry, room temperature, closed container), there are no food safety concerns. You might want to use it within the next few months, though, but mainly due to quality reasons.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Another common misconception: ""best before"" does not indicate immediate spoilage after that date, it is a time by which the manufacturer assures you the product will be in excellent condition. This means also sensory attributes like taste or consistency. Plus there is always a safety margin included to be on the safe side, even if the consumer stores the product under less-than-ideal conditions.

<p>Storing an open bag of beans in the cabinet for 8 weeks probably does matter to taste, while a 4% price difference is easily in the noise.</p>

<h3>Taste Difference</h3>

<p>It seems fair to assume you care about taste differences since you're asking. So for that side of the comparison, it’s sufficient to ask whether you can taste any difference, and that’s fun and easy to test. See <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/3148/2908"">this answer</a> on how to do a triangle test.</p>

<p>Here's an experimental design for coffee bean storage duration: Weigh out the coffee into small plastic bags, put half the bags in the freezer and half the bags in the cabinet, then at different durations, defrost a frozen bag while still sealed (so the beans don't get water condensation from the air), and compare the coffee it makes against a bag from the cabinet. I did this with medium roast beans listed as “high body” and “bold acidity” so degradation would be readily noticeable.</p>

<p>After 2 days, we could not distinguish the frozen from cabinet-stored beans. (That rules out the hypothesis that freezing hurts beans, at least when defrosted in the bag.) After 4 weeks, we still could not distinguish them. After 12 weeks, all tasters could tell, and with high confidence.</p>

<p>Caveats: That was just one kind of bean, made just one way, with 5 tasters who are no cross-section of the world’s population. But each taste test got “statistically significant” results for a hypothesis picked in advance. Good enough for me.</p>

<p>I doubled the duration between each test, hence I didn't test 8 weeks. The taste impact of 8 weeks storage is still in play. Do try the test at 4 and 8 weeks with your favorite coffee. For discussion’s sake, let’s call it likely.</p>

<p>Side note: If you want to stretch out the freshness of a 2 month supply, it’s viable to freeze some of it in small bags.</p>

<h3>Price Difference</h3>

<p>Perception studies have a notion of “just noticeable difference” (JND). A smaller difference than that is unlikely to be noticeable (not the same as “measurable”). A starting assumption for a new domain is JND = 1dB (as it is for audio volume) which is about 26%, but a quick web search gets us a JND threshold for price from <a href=""http://marketingtopics.blogspot.com/2007/08/just-noticeable-difference.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marketing As I know it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it a 10% off sale fails to get your attention while a 50% off sale brings in consumers from the surrounding counties?
  The reason the 10% sale does not excite is that it is below the JND. Research has proven that the JND for price tends to be between 20 to 25%. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In context, a % comparison (whatever the percentage amount) assumes you have a budget or reference in mind for that expense. If the % difference blows your coffee budget, you could compensate by drinking less often, or better yet by making more of your coffee at home than from cafes. If you think of coffee as part of your overall food &amp; drink budget, maybe you could make up a large price difference by drinking less soda or eating less meat (both of which are health and environmental improvements).</p>

<p>For the press, I was thinking the $30 Aeropress kit. However, I figured I might as well ask this stackexchange for other options you would recommend, if any? I like to explore alternatives before purchasing.</p>

<li><p><strong>225 °C (437 °F), Full City Roast</strong>: Medium dark brown with occasional oil sheen, roast character is prominent. At the beginning of second crack.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>230 °C (446 °F), Vienna Roast</strong>: Moderate dark brown with light surface oil, more bittersweet, caramel flavor, acidity muted. In the middle of second crack. Any origin characteristics have become eclipsed by roast at this level.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>240 °C (464 °F), French Roast</strong>: Dark brown, shiny with oil, burnt undertones, acidity diminished. At the end of second crack. Roast character is dominant, none of the inherent aroma or flavors of the coffee remain.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>245 °C (473 °F), Italian Roast</strong>: Nearly black and shiny, burnt tones become more distinct, acidity nearly eliminated, thin body.</p></li>

<hr>

<p>What's happening inside our bodies, is quite a question. I cannot answer that. However, I can answer the entitled question; <em>no, you shouldn't be dehydrated by consuming coffee</em>.</p>

<p>There are numerous studies made on this issue. Some of them including sports area some others are generic.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scott Paluska states:</p>

<p>Caffeine is the most commonly consumed drug in the world, and athletes frequently use it as an ergogenic aid. It improves performance and endurance during prolonged, exhaustive exercise. To a lesser degree it also enhances short-term, high-intensity athletic performance. Caffeine improves concentration, reduces fatigue, and enhances alertness. Habitual intake does not diminish caffeine's ergogenic properties. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the physiologic effects of caffeine, but adenosine receptor antagonism most likely accounts for the primary mode of action. It is relatively safe and has no known negative performance effects, nor does it cause significant dehydration or electrolyte imbalance during exercise. Routine caffeine consumption may cause tolerance or dependence, and abrupt discontinuation produces irritability, mood shifts, headache, drowsiness, or fatigue. Major sport governing bodies ban excessive use of caffeine, but current monitoring techniques are inadequate, and ethical dilemmas persist regarding caffeine intake by athletes.</p>

<p>Paluska, S. A. (2003). Caffeine and exercise. Curr Sports Med Rep, 2(4), 213-9.</p></li>
<li><p>Yang Zhang et al. states:</p>

<p>In practical terms, there was no evidence that caffeine ingestion in moderation would impair fluid balance during prolonged exercise in the heat or during 3 hours of recovery.</p>

<p>Zhang, Y., Carter, S. J., Schumacker, R. E., Neggers, Y. H., Curtner-Smith, M. D., Richardson, M. T., ... &amp; Bishop, P. A. (2014). Effect of caffeine ingestion on fluid balance during exercise in the heat and during recovery. South African Journal of Sports Medicine, 26(2), 43-47.</p></li>
<li><p>Sophie Killer et al. states:</p>

<p>It is often suggested that coffee causes dehydration and its consumption should be avoided or significantly reduced to maintain fluid balance. The aim of this study was to directly compare the effects of coffee consumption against water ingestion across a range of validated hydration assessment techniques. In a counterbalanced cross-over design, 50 male coffee drinkers (habitually consuming 3–6 cups per day) participated in two trials, each lasting three consecutive days. In addition to controlled physical activity, food and fluid intake, participants consumed either 4×200 mL of coffee containing 4 mg/kg caffeine (C) or water (W). Total body water (TBW) was calculated pre- and post-trial via ingestion of Deuterium Oxide. Urinary and haematological hydration markers were recorded daily in addition to nude body mass measurement (BM). Plasma was analysed for caffeine to confirm compliance. There were no significant changes in TBW from beginning to end of either trial and no differences between trials (51.5±1.4 vs. 51.4±1.3 kg, for C and W, respectively). No differences were observed between trials across any haematological markers or in 24 h urine volume (2409±660 vs. 2428±669 mL, for C and W, respectively), USG, osmolality or creatinine. Mean urinary Na+ excretion was higher in C than W (p = 0.02). No significant differences in BM were found between conditions, although a small progressive daily fall was observed within both trials (0.4±0.5 kg; p&lt;0.05). Our data show that there were no significant differences across a wide range of haematological and urinary markers of hydration status between trials. These data suggest that coffee, when consumed in moderation by caffeine habituated males provides similar hydrating qualities to water.</p>

<li><p>Adam Seal, et al. states:</p>

<p>The data indicate that caffeine intake of 6 mg kg−1 in the form of coffee can induce an acute diuretic effect, while 3 mg kg−1 do not disturb fluid balance in healthy casual coffee drinking adults at rest.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<p>The most interesting result here may be the last one as it suggests that you should avoid drinking <em>a lot</em>. 6 mg caffeine per kg may cause dehydration. </p>

<p>Actually, from <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/94/how-much-caffeine-is-in-an-espresso-shot"">this</a> previous discussion we roughly know how much caffeine are there in a cup of coffee; around 160. This means, as a typical 80 kg male, if you don't consume 4 cups of coffee one after another, it should not be a problem. In a few hours, some of the caffeine should be metabolize so you can drink some more. But I don't know the pharmakinetics of caffeine. Maybe a pharmacologist may answer better. In which intervals should we drink the maximum amount of coffee and not to dehydrate?</p>

<p>You can readily understand this if you open up a bag of fresh roasted coffee beans. Smells wonderful. Then grind up those beans and the smell is increased many times. The grinding releases the aromatic compounds. But at this point, the aromatic compounds are evaporating at a greater rate then if they have been left as whole beans. In addition to aromatic evaporation, the grind (and even the whole beans) are being exposed to oxygen which begins to oxidize the bean oil - just as cooking oil can go rancid, so can coffee bean oil.</p>

<p>This all starts happening once beans are roasted and it is increased considerably once those beans are ground.</p>

Then some if not most of the aromatic compounds were already gone. Vacuuming packing does make roasted coffee last longer, but it's probably not the best the coffee could have been.</p>

<p><a href=""https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/coffee-extraction-and-how-to-taste-it"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Extraction is everything that the water takes from the coffee</a>.</p>

<p>So a cup of coffee is coffee extract. A shot of espresso is coffee extract.</p>

<p>As far as natural coffee flavor, it's just marketing geek talk, maybe trying to distance themselves from products like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is hardest for people to understand how we can use coffee flavor without having any coffee in <strong>the product</strong>. The components of coffee flavor can be extracted from a number of natural ingredients that include coffee, chicory and even, believe it not, garlic! It’s hard to imagine that coffee and garlic share the same flavor component, but they do. The expertise of flavor chemists allows them to derive flavors by isolating them from other compounds that don’t contribute to flavor.
  Thus it is possible to produce coffee flavor without caffeine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So maybe your coffee product is emphasizing that it is made from actual coffee. It's like saying ""meat (with natural meat flavor)</p>

<ul>
<li>coffee, and </li>
<li>added flavor.</li>
</ul>

<p>They indirectly state that the main coffee ingredient has been diluted, as coffee is listed as ""coffee (filtered water, coffee extract)"". This could be to assist in controlling the strength of the brew that they use. In terms of caffeine content, there is not enough evidence to suggest that this coffee extract used will have less or more caffeine than a normal cup of coffee.</p>

<p>The next point is the natural flavor (with natural coffee flavor). It is possible to chemically engineer flavors using raw chemical compounds, such as strawberry and banana. These are called ""ethers"" and the manufacture and chemical composition of these are controlled by the regulatory body in your country. The natural coffee flavor comment is vague, as it could mean either ""flavor extracted from coffee"" or ""flavor made from naturally occurring substances"". This could be an email you can send to the product manufacturer, from where they might give you more information and free samples :-)</p>

<p>Its safe to say that the company put some quality control on their product; however, to answer your question,</p>

Nel Coffee is said to feel thicker in the mouth, like a fine wine can have a thicker feel than a cheap wine. If so, the flavor profile may not indicate this distinction.  Best is to give it a try and see whether you think it's better tasting (and feeling) coffee.  </p>

<p>I wonder whether the different mouth feel and layered flavors has mostly to do with the method and not so much with the flannel filter itself.

The Baratza Encore is wonderful, it's quick, the grind is very consistent for a grinder this size and price and the Baratza service is good too. It's ideal for pour-over to French press sized grinds, the espresso grind is less consistent with more fines and boulders.</p>

It's in my opinion even better than the Hario Skerton. Especially with the modifications (you can find instructions online) the grind size is very consistent. However you'll easily spend a couple of minutes grinding. If you are willing to spend a bit more, definitely get a Porlex grinder. They are awesome and fit into the Aeropress (the hollow compartment of the plunger) which is very handy for travels and storage.

<p>There are two different types of semi-autos: those where you have to flick a switch on to start the pump and flick it off again to stop the pump (you can use a measuring glass to ensure you're yielding the same amount of espresso each time), and those that are 'volumetric', i.e. you program into the machine how much water you want it to dose, and it will dose this amount every time. </p>

3895,2,,2017-11-29T21:01:48.287,2,,"<p>The moka pot is by design unsuitable for a cold brew. In a moka pot, the water in the lower compartment is brought to a boil and the resulting steam pushes the hot water through the grounds in the middle basket into the upper part of the pot. So no steam, no pressure, no ""espresso"". </p>

<p>A cold brew works by playing with another factor of the main parameters of chemical coffee extraction (concentration/surface area, temperature, duration), namely the significantly extended extraction time. But changing the parameters will also alter the ratio of the compounds in your final brew, also known as flavour profile. Cold extractions are famous for their lighter, more floral nuances - which in an espresso roast will be overpowered by the darker roast, hence lighter roasts are typically preferred for cold brews. Also, the grind for espresso/moka is a lot finer than for cold brew.</p>

<p>The conclusion:  </p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to try cold brew, find a suitable roast, grind it accordingly and follow a ""recipe"", at least in the beginning, until  you gain some experience. You can also search this site for Q/As tagged ""cold-brew"".</li>
<li>If the moka taste in a cold version is what you are after, you could simply prepare a serving, store it in a suitable container (think mini jam jar or similar) until the next morning. Decide whether the flavour, which will change somewhat overnight, is to your liking. And our taste buds react differently to hot or cold food.- But apparently you ran that experiment already.</li>
<li>If both versions are not really ""your thing"", you can save at least a bit of time by preparing the moka pot before you go to bed. Then, see if you can alter your morning routine so that you are using the n minutes it takes for the moka to sputter for some other task. </li>

A trick that came from my grandmother (along with my moka pot) is to make a pot and chill it, to serve with ice cream (like an affogato but all cold).  This is delicious on a summer day but not what you're looking for.  However, the chilled coffee didn't taste great on its own.</p>

<p>Of course, chilling it then reheating in the morning would be a good way to make bad coffee.  It is possible to make americano with cooled espresso (or strong moka) but only if you like your americano lacking in strength and/or temperature.</p>

<p>What I would do, for drinking hot, is brew it in the morning and transfer to a small flask.  Small flasks don't hold the heat very well so preheating the flask is a good idea (and the flask should be full).  For drinking cold, try adding a pinch of sugar.

<p>However, while was in Cuba I never ever experienced anybody added any bit of sugar in the grounds. So, I watched the whole set up carefully and realized that the sweetness in the Cuban coffee is not the result of the added sugar, but the over roasting of the coffee.</p>

<p>As far as I understood, the “Cuban coffee” is sweet as it is caramelized during the roasting process but not as a result of the added sugar. However, I would like to verify my observation with other coffee enthusiasts observations before finalizing my decision.</p>

<p>Therefore, the question could boil down to whether the Cuban coffee have additional sugar in it?</p>

<hr>

<p>To help you visualize what I'm talking about, I provide a picture of some over-roasted Cuban (Caturra) beans at a plantation near Viñales, Cuba.

<p>The science behind it (vastly simplified is):</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong></p>

<p>This comes down to how adept you are with a steam wand - initially you don't fully submerge the wand, introducing air into the milk. As it starts to heat, the proteins in the milk ""wrap round"" the air bubbles. If you do it right, these bubbles are nice and small resulting in ""micro foam"". You have much more control with a steam wand as opposed to the whisk like implement in frothers.
You'll likely find the bubbles in the froth from your frother are generally larger and thus doesn't last quite as long or look quite as nice as that created by a trained barista in a coffee shop.</p>

<p><strong>Flavour</strong></p>

<p>The natural sugars (carbohydrates) in the milk break down into ""simpler"" sugars with heat and enhance the sweetness of the milk. The steam wand introduces more heat and brings the milk to the ideal temperature (with monitoring). For comparison, I have an espresso machine at home, and I get my milk to roughly 70 C</p>

<p>Now, once the grinder is loaded, don't just hold the button down and let it rip... use short bursts of a few seconds each so the coffee doesn't overheat.</p>
<p>Make sure you have a hold on the top of the unit and give it a shake during bursts so that the grounds get well mixed while grinding. This will make the grind much smoother and consistent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But to achieve consistent flavor you may just need to chill your beans before grinding them.

<p>As room temperatures vary and grinders heat up with use, the consistency of the resulting grind changes.

3911,2,,2017-12-06T03:20:38.740,2,,"<p>Sadly, the accepted answer by @Jose is incorrect. These days, ""Fair Trade"" guarantees pretty much nothing. As some researchers noted, the original idea of Fair Trade Coffee's long gone. For example, refer to Colleen Haight of the Stanford Innovation Review:  <a href=""https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_problem_with_fair_trade_coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Problem with Fair Trade Coffee</a>.</p>

<p>The concept was adopted in 1988 to address the issue of so called ""coffee crisis,"" caused by overproduction of coffee beans worldwide. The initiative was aimed to artificially raise the prices to make sure that coffee growers do not go bankrupt. The whole idea eventually backfired, as it didn't eliminate overproduction, and it is now not uncommon for participating coffee farmers to sell their product to independent buyers, just because those often pay more than so called ""fair trade"" buyers. See <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/article/245424"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffee, Farming Families, and Fair Trade in Costa Rica: New Markets, Same Old Problems?</a></p>

<p>Nowadays, Fair Trade has been reduced to a simple marketing trick to facilitate ""ethical consumerism"" and make consumers pay a few dollars more per each bag of coffee, all that for a sole benefit of the distributor or the retailer. In other words, you are being duped and the farmer gets nothing extra.</p>

3914,2,,2017-12-11T16:51:31.637,3,,"<p>I think this is a rather broad question to answer. Are you looking for overall health effects of coffee or specifically for effects on digestion after eating?</p>

<p>In the former case, recent research has delivered very strong evidence that drinking a moderate amount of coffee (about 3 cups a day) has strong positive health benefits, reducing premature mortality quite dramatically. Among others coffee likely has positive effects on cardiovascular diseases, can be preventative to some types of cancer and alzheimer diseases and has positive effects on diabetes. See for example <a href=""http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2643435/coffee-drinking-mortality-10-european-countries-multinational-cohort-study"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j5024"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""http://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2643433/association-coffee-consumption-total-cause-specific-mortality-among-nonwhite-populations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The latter case is less conclusive I think. There have been studies showing that coffee (the chlorogenic acid in it) reduces glucose intake from digestion. While a decrease in nutrient intake seems like a bad thing at first glance, it may be beneficial for patients of diabetes, because it regulates glucose intake after meals and may help in preventing spikes/drops in insulin levels. I guess for someone struggling to get enough nutrients (due to other digestive diseases for example) excessive coffee consumption could have adverse effects. For healthy people moderate amounts most likely don't have negative effects (see the linked studies). There's also some evidence that coffee has beneficial effects on your microbial composition in your intestines (see <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160509000166"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

<p>There's some other less severe potential issues that might arise, like an increase in reflux symptoms, due to excessive production of stomach acid (however dark roasts of coffee might even have acid reducing effects).</p>

<p>So overall I'd argue that the potential health benefits by far outweigh negative effects, except maybe in some cases of pre-existing conditions such as diseases of stomach and/or intestines.</p>

3915,2,,2017-12-11T17:22:47.360,1,,"<p>In addition to the factors mentioned by Jerry101 you are very right in assuming that it has to do with the roast level. The grinder is of course to most important variable here but I'm assuming you are using the same grinder for all your roasts or rather you are comparing results of different beans using the same grinder.</p>

<p>The temperature has an effect, cooler beans create a smaller and more evenly distributed grind (on the same settings). Everyone who has ever worked as a barista knows this. During the day in a commercial setting the grinder will heat up resulting in a change in grind size. That is why you should check your extraction on regular intervals, when working in a café. See also the study linked by Jerry101 and <a href=""https://baristahustle.com/blogs/barista-hustle/the-grinder-paper-explained"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article on Barista Hustle.</p>

<p>However in my opinion and experience the most important factor in every day situations is indeed the roast level. Just try to squish beans of the same origin but different roast colors (any specialty coffee shop will likely have either Ethiopian, Kenyan, Colombian or ... beans in an espresso blend and as a filter roast) between your fingers and you will notice that the darker beans will crush more easily. They are much more brittle, because they have less water left in them and thus break creating more dust/fines. If you were to freeze your beans (which you should do very carefully, in a sealed and vacuumed package) the temperature would likely be as important or maybe more important than different roast levels.</p>

<p>The bean type (origin) has likely no or only a very small effect on the grind. This is discussed in both sources linked to.</p>

At some point, when the bean turns black the sugars break down into carbon and a brew with those beans would be less sweet than with a standard medium espresso roast. I guess somewhere at around the second crack the sugars will be gone and only ""charcoal"" is left.</p>

<p>So I'm assuming they either mixed the ground coffee with the sugar before you saw the coffee or you somehow missed it otherwise. Because a sweet cup with those black charcoaly things seems unlikely if you don't put sugar in it. As far as I know cuban coffee is indeed coffee with some kind of brown raw sugar mixed in it.</p>

3918,2,,2017-12-12T15:05:19.987,1,,"<p>I think there are quite a lot of misconceptions about Fair Trade floating around here. There are several obvious key points addressed by the Fair Trade concept and several not so obvious points. There's also some discrepancy between what the Fair Trade company propagates and what actually happens to small scale coffee farmers. So I'll first summarize what Fair Trade says it does and then go on to summarize some of the literature on it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Fair Trade guarantees a so called floor price to the producers. That's a minimum price guaranteed to protect against market fluctuations. It is 140 cents per pound for Arabica and 110 cents for a pound of Robusta if I remember correctly.</li>
<li><p>In addition a so called Fair Trade premium, 20 cents I believe is paid, which goes into community development, business development, environmental projects and similar things.</p></li>
<li><p>Also an additional 30 cents per pound are paid if the beans or produced using organic farming practices. So there is some incentive to switch to organic farming wherever it is feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>Participating in Fair Trade means that the producers must have some cooperative form. This is in many ways beneficial. Cooperative form means there is some kind of democratic process involved. Forming cooperatives usually increases market power, increases economy of scale, just to name a few benefits.</p></li>
<li><p>Fair Trade helps small-scale farmers (most coffee farmers are) finance their operations with cheap loans repayable after the produce has been sold. Getting loans is often difficult for small scale farmers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So far so good. This is what the Fair Trade company says it is doing (Fairtrade Foundation 2012). The scientific evidence is however less straight forward and does not only produce a positive picture, however it does suggest that it has overall benefits.</p>

<p>There are many impact and case studies that suggest that farmers participating in the Fair Trade scheme have a significantly reduced livelihood vulnerability. They are e.g. in Nicaragua 4 times less likely to loose their land titles due to market price fluctuations of coffee. However it is also acknowledged that a lot of the produce has to be sold on the conventional market due to too low demand (Bacon 2005).</p>

<p>Other research suggests that Fair Trade does have a positive effect, but only for the most skilled and people owning a farm. However this income effect is not observed for unskilled farm workers. There's also in increase in school attendance in affected regions, although for children of farmers and workers the opposite may be true, probably due to increased economic opportunities (Dragusanu and Nunn 2015).</p>

<p>Anna Milford (2012) summarizes evidence of positive benefit of Fair Trade schemes for farmers, such as higher living standards, decreased child mortality etc. She notes that the forming of cooperatives to participate in the Fair Trade scheme reallocates market power and makes markets more competitive.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, if you go through the literature, you will find that there are very likely positive effects on the livelihood of small scale farmers. The picture is not very straight forward though and which mechanisms contribute to the increased living standards is also not clear. It could just be higher prices, but it could also be the forming of cooperatives and very likely it's a combination of several things.</p>

<p>One last note: Rainforest Alliance and UTZ have much lower environmental standards than organic farming certificates and also much lower social standards than Fair Trade. They are green washing and likely not much more.</p>

<ol>
<li>When I make espresso with pods, it's noticeably weaker than ground coffee. Actually, I've already expected that because of pod's paper wrapping, but it's way over my expectation.</li>
<li>When I close portafilter after put pod, sometimes water leaks from valve. After few tries with pods, I discovered that water leakage occurs when I put pod into pod adapter with certain orientation. When I touch pod's surface, I can feel one side is little thicker than other, and I got leakage when put thicker side down.</li>

Now, the famous <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">South Indian Filter Coffee</a>  and even a generic cup of coffee that you order in your typical Indian tea/coffee shop or download from the coffee machine in a hospital or railway station <em>always</em> has milk and sugar in it. So customers might expect it here and get a bad surprise for a high price: it has actually happened in the early days of our old shop and we were scolded for not warning them it is a black coffee! It's to avoid such confusion we routinely tell clients that the espresso/ Americano contains no milk, and that sugar will be served separately.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Anthora is a paper coffee cup design that has become iconic of New York City daily life. Its name is a play on the word amphora.</p>
  
  <p>The cup was originally designed by Leslie Buck of the Sherri Cup Co. in 1963, to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops in New York City, and was later much copied by other companies. The original Anthora depicts an image of an Ancient Greek amphora, a Greek key design on the top and bottom rim, and the words ""WE ARE HAPPY TO SERVE YOU"" in an angular typeface resembling ancient Greek, for example with an E resembling a capital sigma (""Σ"", a letter pronounced like English ""s""). The blue and white colors were inspired by the flag of Greece. The cup subsequently became the metropolitan area's definitive coffee-to-go cup.</p>
  
  <p>Sales of the cup reached 500 million in 1994 (when it was by far the most popular design for the company's cups), but had fallen to about 200 million cups annually by 2005.</p>

<p>Notable extracts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a city full of symbolism, from bright yellow taxis to black-and-white cookies, New Yorkers also find comfort and nostalgia in a certain cardboard coffee cup. Known as the Anthora, the blue-and-white drinking vessel first became an icon of New York City in 1963 when Leslie Buck, a Czech-American immigrant, designed the first ever to-go coffee cup to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops and diners (...) The height of sales was in 1994 when Sherri sold over 500 million cups.</p>
  
  <p>After the Solo Cup Company bought Sherri in 2005, about 200 million cups per year were sold. A year later, with sales at a standstill, Solo Cup decided to halt its large-scale distribution. The company kept the design alive by selling its licenses to souvenir shops and restaurants. For example, MoMA’s gift store sells a ceramic version designed by Graham Hill in 2003, and many online stores like Amazon and UncommonGoods sell similar products. And it’s been seen in multiple movies and television shows set in New York; actors held the famous Anthora in hit shows like the Sopranos, NYPD Blue, Mad Men, and Law &amp; Order.</p>
  
  <p>The cup made an official comeback to the city in 2015, after the Dart Container company received many requests to bring it back to New York.</p>

The cup and its retro look is expected to appeal to coffee-shop veterans who are familiar with its history as well as young customers who may be seeing it for the first time (...)

That means a high quality, consistent grind, and proper water temperature. I would look into a ceramic or copper Hario after improving these two things. </p>

<p>To clarify, the copper Vario is probably the best dripper because it distributes heat most evenly. Upgrading to this or the ceramic dripper will only improve your coffee marginally, however. Chances are good you could work on your pour technique or get a better grinder, and experience even better results. </p>

3941,2,,2017-12-20T20:50:52.737,2,,"<p>I think your question may need a bit of disentangling, however I will try and deal with your main points. First there are several factors that influence coffee bitterness, and origin, albeit important is not the most influential factor. More on that later. Secondly it is not clear what you mean with ""mild"" coffee. Do you just mean ""not bitter""? Because non bitter coffee is by no means necessarily mild. It can even be more flavorful with very fruity flavors and a lot of acidity, while bitterness may cover up a lot of these flavors.
Regardless of that I will now write some points about how to reduce bitterness.</p>

<ol>
<li>Arabica tends to be lower in bitterness and astringency than Robusta, because Robusta contains more caffeine and chlorogenic acids. So take care you buy 100% Arabica.</li>
<li>The roasting is a very important factor. Dark roasts are much more bitter than light roasts, while lighter roasts emphasize floral, fruity flavors and acidity. In my opinion most people who complain about bitterness in coffee could fix that by drinking lighter roasts. Unfortunately for most people roasted coffee has to look dark brown to almost black with a glossy surface. In most cases beans like that are over roasted. So  you may want to try your dads beans with a different roast profile.</li>
<li>How do you prepare your coffee? Bitterness is often a result of over extraction. Make sure you extract your coffee properly so you get a flavorful, but delicate and pleasant taste. You will find instructions for your preferred preparation method here on the stack exchange, on many websites of specialty coffee shops or you could ask in your favorite specialty coffee shop.</li>
<li>Last but not least, origin can play a role in bitterness. Overall you could probably say (all else equal) that many african coffees are lower in bitterness and higher in acidity. You could try Ethiopian and Kenyan coffees. Ethiopian coffees tend do be very delicate, floral with nice acidity while Kenyan coffees are higher in acidity and fruitiness. Central or South American coffees are probably (all else equal) slightly more bitter, but if the roast and extraction is right, bitterness also shouldn't be an issue. They would have more nutty, chocolaty flavors. Of course there's exceptions. Panama Geishas would be relatively high in acidity compared to other Central American coffees (also much more expensive and the bean is originally an Ethiopian heirloom variety).</li>
</ol>

<p>To sum it up though I would recommend you first focus on point one to three. In my opinion they are more influential here. I'm assuming that you are already using Arabica, but I suggest to try different roast profiles and recipes. If you already did that I would recommend you to buy some washed Ethiopian beans as they produce delicate (you could maybe call them ""mild"" although I don't think it's the appropriate term) cups.</p>

Moka pots of different sizes are available, but each one is designed to brew a certain quantity of coffee: that is, they should always be filled with the same amount of grounds and water when beginning the brew and will produce the same amount of brewed coffee at the end. Otherwise you will be forced to make compromises, such as using too little water or changing the brewing duration (which will result in extraction problems), or using too-much or too-little coffee (which won't allow proper water flow through the grounds brewing). Ultimately, any changes from nominal use will result in poorer outcomes. There are some examples of sizes and brewing techniques at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on moka pot</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Let's clear up some misunderstandings first. The AeroPress as well as the French Press are full immersion brewers. That means that all the water is in contact with the ground coffee for all of the brewing process (not considering pre-infusion). They produce usually a full bodied brew with even extraction. They tend to be less delicate than your average pour-over. The difference between Aero- and French Press is that for the AeroPress the brew is filtered through a paper (or alternatively metal) filter. This filters better fines in your coffee resulting in a cleaner, more delicate cup. The French Press only uses a fine metal mesh as a filter that let's many fines pass. They are obviously in your cup, changing the texture plus they keep extracting, making the brew slightly bitter over time.</li>
<li>The AeroPress is always a good choice, when it comes to brewing devices. It produces delicious, full bodied cups of coffee somewhere in between a pour over and a french press and is great for traveling. However depending on your ambitions you may want to consider a Hario V60 (or another drip method like Chemex, Kalita Wave etc.). Long term they grant you more control over your brew. Obviously traveling is more difficult as you may want to invest into a proper kettle with a gooseneck spout. It's also more expensive, because you will soon realize that you need the gooseneck kettle.</li>
<li>For the grinder, the Porlex Mini has a slight edge over the Hario in my opinion. The grind is slightly more consistent and it fits in the plunger of the AeroPress, which is great for traveling. However it is also more expensive (not so much compared to the new Mini Mill). If it's within your budget, get it, otherwise the Mini Mill is great as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>To sum it up, if your focus is versatility then AeroPress plus Porlex is the best option. If you are ambitious and portability is not that important than a pour over plus any of the grinders would long term be a better choice. However you will see that if you get hooked you won't have any problems investing in more equipment in a year or two and a AeroPress is a great way to start with specialty coffee.</p>

<p>Note that although the Aeropress is durable, it can break if pressure is applied in the wrong direction. I had the plastic crack once after putting it in my checked bag. You might want to get a case for it or at least put it in your carry-on bag. </p>

<li>Involves large, complex machinery</li>

<p>Americans like everything big? In Europe, we use small cars, eat small portions... Americans are not used to that.</p>

<p>Maybe, the whole continent was once virgin and free to be used while Europe (more generally, the old world) was already exhausted and crowded. During those days, Americans got used to use everything in big pieces.</p>

<p>Then, came the coffee. A very small concentrated portion. Americans pour water to have bigger portions. Actually, the invention of Americano is quite interesting in that sense. As far as I know, Americans first mass encounter in espresso is around the second world war. Within the same NATO base, together with Italian soldiers, American soldiers are not fond of drinking small shots of espresso. They started to add boiled water. Italians don't like the idea and make fun of it, so call this newly invented drink <em>Americano</em> to contempt. However, Americans like to have their own style and adopted this name with pleasure.</p>

<p>I think, even this story could explain the major difference in perspectives.</p>

<p>Espresso did not become a staple of Italian or European culture until after WWII. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the late 1950s, most Italians consumed coffee at home, in the traditional moka pot—first built by engineer Alfonso Bialetti in 1933, and now an icon of Italian design worldwide, as Morris explains in his 2008 essay “A History of Espresso in Italy and the World.” But there were exceptions. A young Calvino was a regular customer at Caffè Talmone, a café in Turin where he met with other intellectuals to discuss books and politics. There, he drank Italian espresso with a layer of foam on top, the result of a patent registered by bar owner Achille Gaggia in 1947.

<p>So why did espresso come to dominate European culture after WWII and not the US? Why would any fad or variety necessarily come to dominate the world? Why would a new variety necessarily overcome tradition?  For one thing - espressos require specialty machines that were extremely expensive.

But all of the instructions and guides about pour-over coffee I’ve ever seen recommend a specific <em>time</em> to let the coffee bloom before continuing with the brew. 40-45 seconds seems to be the most common consensus.</p>

<p>But I have to assume that every coffee setup is going to be a little bit different. Small changes in the freshness of the beans, the size and shape of the grind, the temperature of the water, maybe even things like the mineral content of the water? - all of these factors and more are going to have at least some effect on how much CO<sub>2</sub> the coffee wants to offgas and how long it takes. So, “45 seconds” seems like a good guideline or rule of thumb, but I would imagine that some brews need less time and some need more.</p>

<p>So, if I want to gauge my bloom time by my senses instead of by the clock, what should I look for? I have noticed that toward the end of the bloom, the coffee starts to make a faint crackling noise. As the bloom “falls”, it becomes flat, and then cracks begin to appear into the surface, and eventually it falls past flat and becomes a little bit concave. (When it’s flat and starting to crack it looks to me a little bit like a chocolate cookie. It makes me hungry in the morning.)</p>

<p>That’s what I’ve noticed so far about the “phases” of the bloom. At which point in the process is it best to begin the rest of the pour?</p>

3970,2,,2018-01-19T01:39:43.557,5,,"<p>The bloom should be 30s for V60 and 40-45s for Chemex and Kalita and 30s for full immersion methods (like AeroPress or French Press). Blooming is not just about degassing but also to saturate the grounds (which obviously goes hand in hand) and to start dissolving solid compounds (mainly acids and caffeine, sugars come later).</p>

<p>If you'd want to change, just to see what happens (I doubt you will make better coffee with blooming times that diverge a lot from those ""standards"", since they have been proven to be optimal for the respective brewing devices used), then you could consider shortening the blooming time when the coffee is a few weeks old and has oxidized and degassed quite a bit. You notice when it stops bubbling, that would be a definite visual clue. If the same coffee that's been degassing until 30s (for V60), suddenly stops bubbling at 20s, you can try to reduce blooming time a bit. You'll run into trouble though, because your overall extraction time will likely be shorter until you figured out new grinder settings. The phases you describe really depend on the freshness of the coffee and the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> it contains (darker roast would contain more e.g. because it's more porous). The slurry of very fresh coffee is still bubbly and has foam on top after 30s, not noticeably decreasing in volume, while a not so fresh coffee might fall flat after 15s already. I don't know what exactly you mean with cracks, I'll pay attention next time. More like holes where the CO<sub>2</sub> exits, but I do agree it looks a little bit like chocolate cookies, when the coffee bed fell flat and the gas has mostly evaporated.</p>

<p>You can stir with a wooden spatula/spoon/chop stick to make sure you saturate all the grounds, but in my opinion that is not necessary and I've noticed that too much agitation somehow screws up the brewing, often over extracting. Which makes sense, more agitation, faster extraction. If you pour it nicely in concentric circles agitating the grounds slightly, you can manage to saturate all grounds without stirring and without agitating too much. That's ideal in my opinion, but the opinions on this point split widely.</p>

<p>Here I quote his main contribution for solving the great conundrum from science perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All I had done, in fact, was to write down the Washburn equation, derived2 in 1921 to describe capillary flow in porous materials:</p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCOTF.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCOTF.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
  
  <p>where t is the time for a liquid of viscosity η and surface tension γ to penetrate a distance Linto a fully wettable, porous material whose average pore diameter is D. The equation is strictly true only for capillary flow in a single cylindrical tube in the absence of gravitational effects, but can be extremely accurate for more complex materials, including, as I found experimentally, biscuits. Why this should be so is a very interesting question. In practice, I could use the Washburn equation to predict how long different biscuits could be safely dunked by the physicist'smethod, the longest dunkers generally giving the best flavour release (to my palate at least).</p>

Secondly there is some evidence, although it far from being clear, that coffee might be bad for people suffering from reflux disease.

<p>According to that source, gastroesophageal reflux might be triggered by coffee (among others). However it is far from clear, that it really does with studies showing that dropping coffee consumption doesn't significantly change the symptoms to the better.</p>

<p>I suggest you talk about this with a doctor or dietary specialist. This is pure speculation, but maybe you are allergic/intolerant to one of the compounds found in coffee or it is some kind of psychosomatic response. The expectation of becoming nauseous after drinking coffee that leads to actual nausea. Maybe there was some unrelated nausea that you connected to your coffee consumption. Or maybe your nausea is entirely unrelated to the coffee and just happens to coincide with it.</p>

<p>If the problem persists and a doctor couldn't help you, maybe try green/black tea. They contain caffein and can have a similar, somewhat more mellow but also more persistent energizing effect.</p>

<p>To answer the question posed then, no. Peg discs do <em>not</em> produce superior  particle size uniformity than true burr grinders - conical or flat disc. Quite the opposite in well established by myriad reputable sources and can be seen in plots of particle size distribution.</p>

It's common to see many brands proclaim that they are 100% Arabica blends as a quality hallmark. The characteristic and appealing aroma of brewing coffee comes from Arabica beans.</p>

<p>And Robusta which has more caffeine and is traditionally valued in Italy for it's ability to increase crema. It's also sometimes used to increase the caffeine in an espresso blend. Robusta is generally considered to have an inferior flavour profile to Arabica and usually commands lower prices and is largely relegated to use in lower quality, mass market instant coffee.</p>

<p>Robusta is a heirloom bean that was on the verge of extinction only thirty years ago and remains unknown to much of the world. It has a completely different flavour profile. Robusta are huge coffee berries tending towards somewhat intense smokey, nutty and dark chocolate notes in the cup.</p>

<p>Arabica is rare in North America but is said to have a dedicated following in the Philippines, Indonesia &amp; Malaysia where Liberica was planted by colonial Spaniards in the 1800's.</p>

<p>Think intense, complex, unusual and possibly overpowering to get an impression of how Liberica is likely to taste. Liberica has a caffeine content between that of Arabica and Robusta and likely a similar acidity profile. A niche bean that will not appeal to many although it has considerable boutique potential if roasters are able to find roasting profiles that bring specific, highly valued flavours into prominence.</p>

<p>So theoretically if you sip each subsequent cup over a six hour period you'd keep the buzz almost constant. That isn't a very practical approach for most people but drinking a cup of coffee every three to four hours would be a reasonable approximation.</p>

4000,2,,2018-01-29T09:04:18.077,1,,"<p>You're mis-interpreting the significance of the results in the cited experiment. There were also statistically controlled follow up experiments (e.g. <a href=""https://www.home-barista.com/grinders/tgp-ii-particle-distribution-analysis-of-grinder-adjustments-interim-results-t15698.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) that studied grinder particle size distribution in more detail on the same site. </p>

<p>Consequently even when very precise uni-modal particle size regulation is achieved as is the case with industrial roller miller grinders, particle sizes must be deliberately blended for espresso grinds to achieve the required bi-modal distribution.<br><br></p>

<p>This bi-modal size distribution is crucial for proper espresso extraction where the coffee bed (espresso puck) is subject to approx 10 bar water pressure. </p>

<p>Your intent in asking for grinder recommendations capable of producing small particle sizes appears to be based on the mistaken assumption that this is the normal working range for grinders. It is not. A good espresso grinder needs to have a well-defined bi-modal distribution with the largest volume of coarse (approx 500u)  and a smaller volume of fine (approx 50u) particles. And a bulk (brewed coffee) grinder should have a tighter unimodal distribution and a working range of about 100 - 1000u. </p>

<p>The first plot above is the particle size distribution by volume in the OP cited experiment showing the characteristic espresso grinder bi-modal curve with average particle size peaks at approximately 500u and 50u. The second graph shows the bi-modal distribution for a Robur espresso grinder from a subsequent experiment (TGPII, Robur). And the third graph shows a high resolution plot from a instrumentation manufacturer (Sympatec).</p>

<p>As to the specific grinders that the OP was considering, all three are well known and respected commercial espresso grinders. FWIW, large conical grinders are easier to use and produce more consistent results. But all would work well for espresso.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UxEY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UxEY.jpg"" alt=""Espresso shot""></a><br>
Why these things matter<br><br></p>

<p>High quality bulk coffee grinders by contrast show a tighter, uni-modal size distribution at the selected size. The usual working range for brewed coffee is about <a href=""http://www.ditting.com/suggested_settings.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">100u - 900u</a> (Turkish - French press).<br><br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the ground coffee particle size after being placed in water was about
  10 micron (in diameter) on average</p>
</blockquote>

<p>10u can only be said to be the average particle size <em>by count</em>. It must be noted however that the proportion of 10u particles by volume is minuscule. A meaningful characterization of average particle size needs to be done by volume or distribution, the former has a strong correlation with expert taste tests.<br><br></p>

I know that lungo is less concentrated than a regular shot of espresso, so if I pour a lungo into two cups at the same time, as I guess most machines would let me do, will I get the equivalent of pouring two seperate espresso shots or will I just get a weaker tasting espresso in each cup?

Plainly speaking it's just a bad way to dilute espresso, because you are extracting more of the bitter compounds that you don't actually want to have in the coffee.</p>

<p>If you want to fill two cups at the same time, you'll have to use a double basket (with two spouts), which means that you will also pull a double shot automatically. Using the double basket means that you also need double the amount of coffee as compared to a single basket (with one spout).</p>

<p>So pulling with a double basket will give you two separate lungo shots, one in each cup. If you put a large cup under both spouts you will get a double lungo.</p>

<p>The better way to dilute espresso is to fill the cup with water (to your taste and strength preference) and pull a regular shot in the cup with water already in it in order to make an americano.</p>

<p>That works well enough for most spices. But the quality of coffee is very sensitive to the grind quality, that is how evenly it is ground and what size the particles end up being. Quality coffee grinders use <em>burrs</em> which are closely mating &amp; adjustable grinding surfaces. Burr grinders produce much more consistent, higher quality ground coffee. If you don't taste much difference and can't see what the fuss is all about, then you don't have much need for an expensive grinder.</p>

<p>You might want to try tasting a few cups of coffee made at a good coffee shop (not a typical chain) that use high end grinders. </p>

<p>If there is a wow factor in the taste for you though.. then it's worth considering buying some sort of burr grinder. Which can add up to a $1,000 or more a year.

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghyTwFhqRo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Backflushing</a> can only be done on machines like yours that have a 3-way valve. And it's basically just putting a blind (sealed) basket or rubber disc into the portafilter and pulling three short shot cycles. That is put the portafilter, with a blind basket into the group then let the pump run for about 8 seconds, then stop the pump for a few seconds. Then repeat two more times before removing the portafilter.</p>

<p>This flushes out the brew path. Backflushing with water is safe but you shouldn't do a frequent chemical backflush on an E61 type machine. Most of the time this can be resolved by doing a backflush (sometimes you may need to do two or three backflushes) which will clean the brew path. When was the last time you did a backflush on the machine? You should be backflushing with plain water weekly. And with a food safe detergent every 200 shots.</p>

<p>When the portafilter does remain under pressure it means that the ""3 way over-pressure valve"" that normally relieves the group pressure is sticking. Or more precisely something in the expansion chamber is sticking or the internal E61 cam isn't moving completely smoothly. </p>

<p>The easiest way to check for scale (mineral) buildup on an E61 machine like yours is to remove the gicleur chamber nut and mushroom at the top of the E61 assembly and visually inspect the removed parts and the group head internals which will now be visible.</p>

<p>Should it actually take 10-60 seconds to press down all the water given the pressure from above? It seems like almost all the water (up to #2) is through the filter by the time I get half way down the thing and the last half of pressing gets easier, not harder as you might expect with more pressure.</p>

<p>To press down the plunger of the Aeropress and thus all the water through the filter and grinds should take around half a minute if the Aeropress is completely filled with water.</p>

<p>You should not put milk in it. To make a latte just make a strong AeroPress coffee and put the milk (steamed or heated) in afterwards. That's how a Latte is done. Maybe some of the milk fat is stuck at the silicon part or the inside wall of the Aeropress. Just wash it well with detergent and it should be perfectly fine.</p>

<p>If the water is pushed through too fast or too slowly, the usual problem is a wrong grind size. If the particles are too small they clog up the filter paper and if they are too coarse the water passes too easily. The grind can be anywhere from fine sea salt coarseness (I think in the US it's often sold as kosher salt) to French Press coarseness. If you go for a coarser grind add more coffee or increase brewing time. Lately there's a trend to use a coarse grind but a high coffee to water ratio. Just experiment and see what works best for you.</p>

<li><p>Put the plunger in the Aeropress chamber (only the tip) and turn it
upside down so it's inverted on the plunger</p></li>
<li><p>Add your ground coffee and hot water</p></li>
<li><p>Steep for your desired time</p></li>
<li><p>Place the filter in the cap and attach the cap to the top of the inverted Aeropress</p></li>
<li><p>Quickly flip it over onto your coffee mug</p></li>
<li><p>Press, top off with any milk or water you want, and enjoy</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The major benefit here is you can use whatever grind size you'd like and extract for as long as you want.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding the hot milk in the Aeropress chamber</strong>, you probably don't want to do that. It was really hard to push down because milk has proteins and fats in it that, and the microfilter isn't designed to deal with those larger molecules. It's best to just make a really strong coffee with low volume and add milk afterwards.</p>

Now when I drink, accidentally, 3 or more days (8-16oz/day) of instant decaf coffee in a row and then skip a 4th day....an, albeit milder, old caffeine withdrawal headache makes me notice I've missed out.

<p>As another answer explained, don't put milk into the aeropress, it won't filter properly. You can add milk to the cup afterwards if you like.</p>

<p>About 20 seconds to push the coffee through the aeropress with light to moderate pressure (just leaning on the plunger) would be a good time. Your description of the water passing easily at first and the plunger being ""too loose"" sound like your coffee grind is too coarse.</p>

<p>The <em>""half-life""</em> of caffeine, which is how long it takes your body to eliminate half of the caffeine in your system is normally about five hours. A lot of foods, drugs and diseases can affect this though.</p>

<p>For example, narigenin, the enzyme that makes grapefruit juice bitter inhibits CYP1A2 and can prolong the half-life of caffeine by 30% . Oral contraceptives can double the half life of caffeine. And various prescription drugs e.g. fluvoxamine significantly extend the half-life as well.</p>

<p>Liver disease can have dramatic effects. One lady with alcoholic hepatic cirrhosis was reported in the literature as having a half-life of 168 hours for caffeine elimination. So her caffeine high would literally last for days after one espresso.</p>

<p>Arabica beans produce a richer taste and have a better balance of sweet acidity. Sugar, fruit, berry and chocolate flavours are common and the characteristic winey taste of higher of higher quality coffee is due to Arabica's excellent acidity. Also the much remarked upon and pleasantly appealing aroma of roasting coffee is due to Arabica beans. Brazil is the largest producer and Arabica beans represent 75% of all coffee sold in the world.</p>

<p>Robusta by contrast has a stronger, harsher full bodied and more bitter taste with a grainy flavour profile and earthy or peanut aftertaste. Traditional Italian espresso blends typically incorporate about 10% Robusta because Robusta beans create more crema. The majority of Robusta beans go towards the bulk manufacturer of instant coffee where price trumps quality concerns.</p>

<p>Robusta beans contain more caffeine, are easier to grow and produce substantially higher yields. Vietnam is the largest producer.</p>

However two major reviews of the literature identified more than 417 papers a review of which concluded:</p>

<p>Caffeine is metabolized by your liver, specifically by the CYP1A2 pathway of the cytochrome P450 enzyme complex and there are a lot of prescription drugs, foods and herbal remedies that will slow or speed up caffeine clearance (elimination).</p>

<p>What you could have done to speed up your recovery was to stay well hydrated, consider moderate aerobic exercise and if possible sleep through the worst of it. But to answer your question directly, a meal of charbroiled beef with cabbage, cauliflower or broccoli, all foods known to induce CYP1A2 activity would hasten caffeine elimination. </p>

<p>As would, in theory, the prescription drug regadenoson (adenosine agonist) or varied mild anti-anxiety or tranquilizers for symptomatic relief.</p>

<p>You'd especially want to avoid, if possible foods the following that would prolong the half life of caffeine: grapefruit juice, cumin, tumeric, St. John's wort, peppermint tea. And if practical avoid prescription drugs that would strongly inhibit CYP1A2 e.g. ciprofloxacin, fluoroquinolones, fluvoxamine, verapamil and oral contraceptives.</p>

<p>If you are drinking this yourself, you can make it and bottle it however you like. Whether that means doing what is easiest with what is available or going all out and buying supplies, it's up to you. If you are giving it to others or possibly selling it (your question is pretty ambiguous), then you want to try and create the most delicious cold brew you can at the most economical price. Glass definitely looks a lot better, and as I will talk about next, brings better flavour when kept refrigerated.</p>

<p>If you want to drink it the day or two after you make it, then a plastic bottle is probably fine, but the main difference is how well the bottle keeps out light, and lets out air. It may seem as though plastic is completely air tight, but there can be gases exchanged through plastic that can change the composition of the coffee chemistry. If you want a liquid to stay fresh for longer, glass is always a better bet than plastic. </p>

<p>You <em>CAN</em> make cold brew however you want. Tap water and PET bottles are fine for easy home brewing. It is, however, widely acknowledged that water plays a much more vital role in coffee brewing than previously thought, and when your coffee grounds are in contact with water for many hours as is the case in cold brew, you can suffer from that. Good water and glass bottles will always be better than tap water and plastic bottles.</p>

<p>The iconic and appealing smell of freshly roasted or brewing coffee is due to arabica coffee. Instant coffee though is mostly, and often completely, made from lower cost robusta beans. Robusta beans have a distinctly different taste and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/4032/why-are-robusta-beans-considered-low-brow"">aroma profile</a>.</p>

<p>And while industrial roasters have gotten very good at coaxing arabica-like flavours from instant coffee, the underlying qualities are still there and still noticed in the aroma. So the short answer is that your brand of instant coffee smells a lot more like typical robusta beans than the more desirable arabica beans.</p>

<p>Aroma is somewhat subjective and can be easily influenced by suggestion. I can understand your perception of soya sauce, although that characterization might be a bit off the mark. Soy sauce covers a large range but is something of an earthy umami aroma usually having malty seasoning, cooked potato, caramel, alcoholic, smoky or honey notes.</p>

<p>My 6 cup Bialetti is probably from the 1960s, but the modern gasket still fits and I've replaced it before (over 10 years ago, but I don't use it daily). It was blowing steam from the screw joint so I checked and replaced the cracked gasket. With the new one, I get about a teaspoonful of thick coffee before the sputtering (that normally marks the end of the brew) starts from the tower. If I leave it sputtering I eventually get a little less than I should, but enough to drink. I don't normally tamp it, but smooth over the grounds with the back of a teaspoon before wiping the sealing face of the basket with my hand. I use a very small gas ring, with flames smaller than the base (a little smaller to start, reducing once the flow starts). </p>

<p>Assuming there were grounds caught in the seal, once I took the seal out and cleaned it, before assembling wet. It behaved much better, but only that time. I normally only rinse the pot (it's very well seasoned) but I'll give it a good scrub before I next use it. I wonder if the seal doesn't seal very well dry, and whether wiping a thin layer of neutral cooking oil over it would help. Is this a good idea? </p>

<p>The ""quality"" of coffee is mostly determined by the bitterness and taste. Fresh, great quality coffee is often bright and has complex flavours that fill your palette. Diner coffee is usually bland and more bitter. </p>

<p>In high-quality beans, the enjoyment of the coffee is then more down to personal taste. That is, whether someone likes a bright, almost tea-like single origin from Ethiopia, or a deep-bodied Sumatran coffee with herbal notes.</p>

<p>This Kopi Luwak coffee will certainly have it's own distinctive taste, that's for sure. Will it taste better than cheap coffee like Maxwell house? Yes, probably. Will it be the best coffee you've ever had? Maybe not, and that is just fine. People drink this coffee because it is rare and sought after, not neccesarily because they are looking for the best cup.</p>

<p>As for brewing it, I would suggest trying it a number of ways, because each brewing method brings out different flavour profiles. French press will allow you to experience the body that is likely from a South-east asian coffee and will allow the natural oils onto your palette. Pour-over will take away some of that body but accentuate the herbal tones and bring out the top-end in terms of flavours. Espresso is always interesting, and the concentrated method could yield some surprising flavours.</p>

<p>If you have the means to try it, I would. It's a neat experience and if you are keen on coffee, tasting more coffee, no matter where its from, is always a good thing.</p>

<p>As for cleaning your equipment, just make sure to do a regular cleaning of your espresso machine/french press to remove any residue. This doesn't have to be intensive, just make sure there are no leftover grounds. For you grinder, I would disassemble as much as possible and wash and dry the parts. Grinders always retain a decent amount of grounds, and those mixing in with the expensive Kopi Luwat could change the flavour.</p>

4069,2,,2018-02-24T06:18:39.197,5,,"<p>Your intuition is correct, modifiers like sugar or creme will only obscure a lot of nuance so connoisseurs, professionals &amp; judges will try new coffees or espresso as brewed without adding anything.</p>

<p>Depending on the quality of coffee and a person's preferences they may sometimes add something after the initial taste. And some connoisseurs may order something like an espresso macchiato (espresso with a tiny amount of textured milk) or routinely add e.g. one sugar when drinking a coffee that they are familiar with or just for variety. But in general the better the quality of coffee and the more serious the connoisseur, the less likely they are to be adding anything to their coffee.</p>

<p>Certainly if you are trying to discern what a new coffee tastes like, you shouldn't be adding anything initially (coffee roasters and buyers have a special method for tasting nuances in new coffees called <em><a href=""http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;d=cupping-protocols"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cupping</a></em>). Even if you customarily like to add something if you want to learn more about coffee and improve your palate you should at least have a sip before adding anything so that you develop a better ability to discern subtle differences.</p>

<p>Espresso like scotch can be an acquired taste for some and they may find that they add less sweetener over time as the intense taste grows on them. And it's worth noting that high quality coffee has a rich, winey base overlaid with desirable flavours and little, if any bitterness. And properly textured milk in lattes is already quite sweet and creamy in texture so there is little, if any need for additional sweetness.</p>

4073,2,,2018-02-25T17:54:16.060,2,,"<p>Boiler water level has a significant effect on steam capacity and temperature stability. It may also impact steam quality.</p>

<p>There are three steam characteristics to look at: the amount of steam available, steam power, which is pressure but it's easier to visualize this as <em>velocity</em> and quality. High quality steam should be dry and saturated, not wet. Within the safe (design) operating range of water level for your boiler, a lower water level means that there is more <em>headspace</em> or space for the steam. This means that you will have a larger supply of steam, higher quality (drier) steam and better temperature stability because it's easier to heat a volume of steam than the same physical volume of water.</p>

<p>A higher water level will reduce the effective amount of steam available and tend to create wet steam as more water gets entrained into the steam. Conversely if your machine sees heavy use for espresso but not steam, you may benefit from a somewhat higher water level which favours water temperature stability.</p>

<p>The intended water level serves several masters as a espresso machine requires water and steam and of course safety, cost, stability and steam quality in an usable balance. On a single boiler machine you can't really increase the boiler pressure to increase steam power because it would make the machine run too hot for quality espresso extraction. In general, it is desirable to operate single boiler machines on the lower end of the safe water level range for better steaming ability.   </p>

<p>However if you have a consumer machine with an inadequately small boiler you may find that lower water levels produce an apparently anemic steam jet. The proper fix for this would be a larger, more capable boiler but pragmatically a higher water level will then produce a more usable steam flow because the entrained water in wet steam has more inertia or <em>force</em> at the expense of less steam capacity and lower quality steam. Or to put it another way in a machine that has too small of a boiler you may need to keep the water level higher to get enough steam power but it will also degrade the steam quality and will make texturing milk more challenging.</p>

<p>Is your end goal brewed coffee or concentrate? For yourself or as a commercial product? Is quality (taste) a primary consideration or are you concentrating on yield and/or caffeine and don't care much about taste? You should also describe your brew method in detail, tell us how you are grinding your coffee, how much coffee and water you use (brew ratio) and if you measure it, TDS (total dissolved solids).</p>

<p>You are almost certain to degrade quality if you press or ""spin"" your grounds to increase yield. If you proceed anyway, a centrifuge is more likely to both produce a better product and maximize yield. Pressing grounds will over-extract and create a bitter result.</p>

<p>You might want to consider brewing espresso, rather than coffee if yield is important. Better quality espresso machines will have quite dry pucks (grounds) and you have the advantage of a concentrated product, if that is a goal. Otherwise you can just add hot water to make an <em>Americano</em> or <em>Long black</em> which is an end product quite similar to brewed coffee but with the higher yield you desire.</p>

<p>You are correct in assuming that the tamping will increase brew times and therefore the coffee will be in contact with the water for longer. This of course produces a stronger coffee.</p>

<p>However, this is not the ""correct"" way to increase the strength of coffee. The generally accepted way of doing this is changing the brew ratio. The brew ratio is the ratio of grounds to water, typically denoted in grams. The ratios range greatly depending on type of brewing. Tamping the coffee will also affect the flavour of the coffee, because one part of water will extract from one part of grounds longer, producing an undesirable taste.</p>

<p>If you want stronger coffee, simply add more grounds to your filter basket. This way your water is not in contact with the grounds for too long, but rather extracts from more grounds. The flavour will be noticeably better through this method.</p>

There may be some merit however because it is presented with a ""fair and impartial tone"" and invites experiences over opinions that may be backed up with references. Especially in the world of coffee, where brewing methods are identified by <em>brands</em>, it is hard to not talk about specific products. Therefore, I'll try to answer as best I can.</p>

<p>First, let's talk about some of your suggestions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ideally, double-walled tempered glass housing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of the appeal of an Aeropress is that is durable, fool-proof, and easily brought on camping trips or stored in drawers and backpacks. Along with being bulky, doubled-walled glass or stainless steel would add weight and fragility.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fine stainless steel filter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is definitely an option, and you can buy metal filters for a few popular brew methods including Chemex and Aeropress, and off course, french press is typically a metal mesh filter. The thing about metal filters compared to cloth or paper is that even the finest ones cannot filter at the same level. Metal filters will always let in more oils and fines compared to paper, and this is why the might not be desirable for an Aeropress, where clean, bright coffee is expected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any reason why cork wouldn't work for this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cork does seal well under the right conditions. But that's the key: right conditions. In a wine bottle, there is 1/2 and inch to 3/4 of an inch in diameter, and the cork is typically more than an inch long. It has also been created, molded, and formulated specifically for that task. A cork plunger would need to be thicker and be made specifically for that application to work, because you would't want it to flex and break the seal. </p>

<p>Also, cork is terrible at remaining taste-neutral. Every cup of coffee you brewed would impart taste into the cork and negatively effect every other cup. You could prevent this by putting a layer of something on the bottom if the cork, but then you start looking at using plastics.</p>

<p>If you're looking for brewing methods similar to the Aeropress, I might suggest something like the <a href=""http://www.rokkitchentools.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ROK</a>. It uses hand pressure to extract espresso. No, i is not as easily carried around like an Aeropress but has a similar function.</p>

<p>If you're looking for brewers that have no plastic, well, there are many options in that field too such as french press, Chemex, mocha pot, espresso machine etc.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you could try modifying a glass french press with some sort of cloth filter to create a sort of reverse Aeropress. You can try looking around other options online too.</p>

<p>Hope this helps to answer your question!</p>

4088,2,,2018-03-15T17:49:17.740,6,,"<p>There are a few elements to this answer, so I'll try to tackle them one by one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is it possible to brew another cup with the used grounds...?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. It is physically possible to do this. Just do what you described and voila, more liquid into the next mug.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>this would be the same as using more water and brewing over a carafe to brew twice as much coffee</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is where you are wrong. Brewing coffee is chemistry, whether you are using a Chemex or an espresso machine or a cheap drip machine. Each stage of brewing produces different flavours from the coffee. I can't guarantee this is accurate but here is an example of what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>The first part of your pour controls the bitterness of the coffee. The bloom helps to get rid of CO2 and dissolves oils on the beans and in the grounds. It will develop your ""body"".</p>

<p>The second part of your pour will determine the sweetness. Some people swear by small pours over a longer period of time, while others prefer the ease of just slowly filling the brewer evenly.</p>

<p>Finally, the last half of your pour controls the intensity of your cup. This is where your question comes in. More water in this last section will produce a weaker cup, and less water a stronger one.</p>

<p>All of these parts of the pour need to be melded together to create a delicious cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Pouring your first cup then re-using the grounds for the second one means the second cup misses out of the main part of the brew. Yes, the liquid will tastes like coffee, but will not have very much caffeine, and will lack the flavours present in a well-brewed cup. You're basically making ultra-weak, bland coffee. </p>

<p>If you want to make more coffee and don't care about the strength, brew a larger batch into one carafe, then swirl and split it between tow cups. You should adjust your grounds-to-water ratio accordingly though.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you answer your question!</p>

<p><strong>Percolators have mechanisms to re-brew and re-brew coffee till eternity.</strong></p>

<p>You can continue or stop the process whenever you want. That's why, instant coffee producers use percolator columns to gain the maximum yield from the same amount of beans. And, of course, that's also the reason why instant coffees taste (relatively) quite terrible.</p>

<p>I hope this answer may lead you to have some sense about the trade-off in between taste, yield and process of brewing coffee.</p>

<p>In my opinion learning how to brew quality espresso, and the different factors that effect a quality espresso and espresso drinks is most challenging and also requires the most knowledge (how to prepare the grinds, the whole milk steaming/foaming process etc.) it also requires expensive equipment unfortunately. I think these skills would be good if you are looking for a barista job though. </p>

<p>For brewing at home i think you should master the french press which is a very inexpensive method to brew coffee (french press being like $20 for a good one) but is also my favorite coffee brewing method. It is also very simple to brew, you just have to make sure you get the correct ratio (using a scale is best) of water to coffee and grind the beans well (a burr grinder is best but can be kinda expensive. This would be a cost of any brewing method should you decide to grind your own beans). </p>

To become a home barista all one is to do is making coffee at home. Of course you can be a shitty home barista if you make shitty coffee at home. In order to become a good one, you should probably learn a few different brewing methods, of which Espresso is definitely not one. Not because it is not a good drink, but because with home equipment you can never quite reach the quality you can achieve with professional equipment. To buy quality professional grade home equipment you'll have to reach very deep into your pockets and spend probably something around 10k. It thus really doesn't make much sense to invest in espresso equipment at home in my opinion.</p>

<p>A good alternative is a stove top coffee maker, the most known brand is Bialetti and they make in my opinion the best products. It gives you a coffee in between filtered methods and espresso. It's quite thick in texture and has a lot of body. It's an easy preparation method and the initial investment is very low.</p>

<p>The way to go in my opinion though, as you have pointed out as well, is making pour-overs at home. You could get a Hario V60 plus the filters, which would set you back around 20 bucks. With that you can make filter coffee as good as any coffee shop, plus you can learn a lot about the main parameters that affect extraction and the taste of your coffee. The coffee stack exchange has a lot of information on that to get you started. Also most bigger specialty coffee shops have brewing guides on their websites and youtube. Just check them out and start experimenting. You will quickly get a feel for what you like and how to get there.</p>

<p>The only likely pest to be found in green coffee beans is the coffee berry borer, <em>Hypothenemus hampei</em>. This is a tiny, 2mm black beetle. And legitimate green beans would invariably have been fumigated to eradicate this pest. </p>

<p>Drying green coffee beans to critical water content levels, followed by freezing @ -15C for 2 - 6 days appears to be an effective alternative to fumigation. However this would normally be redundant to fumigation that has already taken place. And there remains some controversy about the impact of freezing upon cherry quality.</p>

However, many more articles and studies have come out recently to counteract this as more experts are weighing in and saying that if anything at the very least the benefits of coffee is neutral.  There is some bad but its not that bad, and the good isn't that great.  I linked to a few articles talking about that below.</p>

<p>Regarding the debate for french press vs. instant coffee, this could come down to a personal preference.  Some things to think about regarding French Press are how is the coffee grounds stored, how are the coffee ground, is there availability to fresh and clean and hot water, how hot is the water, how much patience do you have, and how do you like it.<br>
I love my french press and would do that over instant any day.  However, I get whole beans, store them in an air-tight jar ( <a href=""https://www.mysticmonkcoffee.com/collections/equipment/products/monk-coffee-vault-storage-black"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coffee vault</a> ), and then hand grind them daily when I brew it in my french press.  All of this many people do not have the patience for the coffee, especially since after that, you have to let the coffee steep for a few minutes (similar to Tea).  </p>

<p>In the past I had bad coffee (which could affect the health benefits) when the grounds weren't stored properly, or the grinder wasn't cleaned/sanitized properly.<br>
Also, I make sure to measure the temp of the hot water I put in.  Currently we have a water purifier that has a ""hot water"" setting, and I use that.  The water is about 170, which is important not to be above 190.  Many coffee houses, home brewers and even Keurigs will brew at 200+, but can be adjusted to as low as 180.  Coffee shops will do this so it stays hotter longer.  The proof is inconclusive, but I think there is some studies suggesting that the temperature has something to do with the production of the Acrylamide.  This does greatly affect the taste of the coffee.  You can find something <a href=""https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/DianaGendler.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> at the Physics Fact Book, and something <a href=""https://www.fivesenses.com.au/blog/brew-temperature-and-its-effects-on-espresso/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> at the five senses.</p>

<p>One of my best friends will only drink instant coffee, and loves it, and has been for about 30 years.  He likes how quick it is, and likes the taste, but he also adds cream.  </p>

<p><strong>Overall health benefits / disadvantage are leaning towards positive results, assuming its in moderation and everything is clean and clear, regardless of the method.</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, no-one is compelled to drink coffee - and I'm perfectly fine without it. However so many people enjoy this drink so much, and it would be nice if I could experience the same pleasure. The fact that I like the <em>flavour</em> of coffee (as when eating a coffee-flavoured sweet) tells me that if only I could find a variety of the drink which did not include the bitterness, then I would enjoy it.</p>

<p>I have asked this question of several people over the years, who have suggested that I try latté, for example - however the fact that the coffee is diluted by a large amount of milk does not solve the problem. It means less flavour - and yes, less bitterness - but the bitterness is still there.</p>

<p>The other day I was recommended to try an Ethiopian coffee called Bukeela. I was told that this was especially weak, and that I might be able to take it. So.. I tried it. I added lots of sugar. However it was still too much for me. Yes, the coffee was weak - but that just meant that the flavour was weaker. The bitterness was still present, and still made me unable to drink it. The sugar did not help. It simply meant that I had two tastes in my mouth simultaneously: sweet: but still bitter.</p>

<p>Edit: the related question on this site regarding ""sweet coffee"" does not address my question. Sweetness isn't the same thing as non-bitterness. As stated here, even if I add lots of sugar, I just get 2 tastes simultaneously: sweet and bitter. The bitterness is still there. That other question doesn't mention bitterness at all.</p>

<p>It seems that my taste buds are <em>especially</em> sensitive to anything bitter. I can not drink beer, and I dislike certain vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts, because of their bitterness.</p>

<p>So the question for all you coffee experts is: does there exist a variety of coffee which retains the yummy flavour, but which has <em>no trace</em> of the unpalatable bitterness?</p>

4129,2,,2018-04-05T14:03:18.883,6,,"<p>great question.</p>

<p>There are a few factors that will give your coffee the flavor and such that you want.  To fully answer your question, we also need to understand some of your preferences and the answer may change slightly depending on your those.  </p>

<p>One General question is when you say ""bitterness"", do you mean ""acidity"" of the bean, or potentially a taste associated with the water (hard or soft water taste, possibly acidic water or akaline water)?  You may not know or be able to pinpoint what I mean.  I get two different flavor results from when I brew at work versus when I brew at home in the same french press with the same beans. </p>

<p>I personally find that some of the bitterness is caused by the process of brewing, which has a few factors.<br>
I personally enjoy the French Press, which not everyone has the availability or patience to do that.  I found that the French Press makes the taste stronger, but less bitter, and I can dial back the strength of the flavor based on the amount I use in the french press.<br>
Along those lines, the <strong>water</strong> you use can make a <strong>HUGE</strong> difference as well.  I try to make sure my water is always purified and from a clean container, and that the temperature is not too hot (personally between 180-190).  I worked at one place that had Keurigs, and some of them had the water container on the side.  I would have to wash those out and flush out the water inside before I got a ""clean"" non-bitter tasting cup of coffee, although they were used all day.  The company eventually switched to having an in-line water supply and filter for the Keurigs which greatly helped (when the water filter was clean).  Another company I worked for only had the ""Bunn-O-Matic"" and the bitterness was also caused by a build up of calcium inside the brewer as well as too hot of water (200F+).  I adjusted both of those things and would clean out the brewer weekly and people flocked to the coffee station after that.</p>

<p>Coffee type I think can be a factor depending on your method and your preference as well.  A few friends like lighter roasts so they don't get the acidity of the roast / coffee, which they consider to be the bitterness.  Some of those friends will also swear by ""flavored"" beans/grounds, as typically those are lighter roasts and the flavor will some of that bitterness they are referring to.  </p>

<p>I have also tried <a href=""https://www.mysticmonkcoffee.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mystic Monk Coffee</a> and I find them to not be bitter for both their regular blends and their flavored blends.</p>

<p>Last suggestion, I have another friend and his wife both love Columbian coffee because of the flavor and it doesn't have the acidity, but it has some bitterness with the coffee flavor. </p>

4131,2,,2018-04-07T06:28:55.227,4,,"<p>You can reduce the bitterness of coffee, but maybe not to a level that you'll like.</p>

<p>(One friend said he couldn't stand bell peppers, explaining that if they tasted 10x as strong, I probably wouldn't like them, either. I've since asked people if there's a particular flavor they don't like, and heard a variety of surprising responses.)</p>

<p>Judging by the coffee at many cafes, lots of people must not mind bitter coffee or covering it up with sugar and cream. I think good coffee should be good black.</p>

<p>It's possible to buy tasty 100% dark chocolate from some artisan chocolate makers. They have to start with suitable beans and use well-tuned processes. Sloppy won't cut it.</p>

<p>Similarly, <strong>it is possible to make coffee that's not (very) bitter.</strong> It requires selecting suitable beans <em>and</em> applying a good process.</p>

<p>I don't know how to find suitable beans in general, but <strong>try 100% Kona coffee.</strong> (If it doesn't say “100%” then it’s heavily diluted.) I've found some other excellent beans from Mexico and Colombia. I think all of these were medium roast.</p>

<p><strong>Brewing technique is critical.</strong> Try using an AeroPress because it gives lots of control over the brewing variables, it limits extraction by brewing with a portion of the water (dilute it after brewing), and immersion methods are more forgiving.</p>

<p><a href=""https://angelscup.com/blog/taste/coffee-extraction-sour-vs-bitter/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page on Angels’ Cup</a> has a helpful introduction to brewing variables and experimentation. To summarize from that and other sources:</p>

<p><strong>Over-extraction</strong> during brewing will cause bitter results. You can adjust that via: <strong>coarser grind,</strong> or <strong>shorter brewing time,</strong> or <strong>cooler brewing water</strong> [Angels’ Cup says hotter but other sources say cooler], or <strong>less agitation</strong> (stirring), or adjust the coffee:water ratio. These recommendations assume you're close, but any variable can be off in either direction.</p>

<p>All these adjustments <strong>can make the brew more sour,</strong> or too strong or weak, or otherwise unbalanced. There's a careful balance to achieve. They say temperature affects the sour notes more than the bitter notes.</p>

<p>(Heating the coffee afterwards should not make it more bitter, or not much, since it's no longer in contact with the grinds.)</p>

<p>Experiment! Start with adjusting the grind size. Finer grind makes for more bitter brew. Coarser grind makes for more sour brew. In between should be a happy trade-off.</p>

<p>Brewing is quite sensitive to grind size. <em>If you don't get an even grind, you'll have some large particles and some small particles, which makes for some bitter notes and some sour notes together.</em></p>

<p>Therefore you'll need <strong>a good burr grinder.</strong> (I took recommendations from <a href=""https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-coffee-grinder/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Sweethome review</a>.)</p>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/science/coffee-freeze-beans-grind.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NY Times article</a> adds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… water extracts flavor from smaller coffee grounds faster than bigger ones. An inconsistent grind means sour taste from the small grains, and a bitter one from the big, all at the same time.</p>
  
  <p>… the colder the bean [when grinding], the more uniform particles it produced, and the more even the flavor.</p>
  
  <p>… put the beans in the freezer — just keep them packed air tight to avoid staleness and moisture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(However, the Baratza grinder is not designed for grinding frozen beans.)</p>

<p>Some tips to wrap up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean the grinder often (monthly?) and clean the brewing equipment daily so they don't accumulate rancid oils.</li>
<li>Try decaf. The decaffeination process reduces bitterness.</li>
<li>Try medium and light roasts.</li>
<li>Start with the AeroPress manufacturer's recipe, but don't stir 10 times. Put in the grinds, pour in the hot water up to #2, dab it with the stir stick a little to help it all get wet, wait 10 seconds, stir gently 2-3 times, then press.</li>
<li>Use a thermometer to get the water temperature right.</li>
<li>Use a scale to measure out the coffee.</li>
<li>Start with grind size #14 if you're using the Baratza Encore grinder. With 40 grind size steps, adjusting by ±1 step makes a noticeable taste difference.</li>
<li>Don't bother with inverted (upside down) methods--those tend to produce more bitter coffee, and they risk a mess with hot water.</li>
<li>A paper filter produces ""smoother"" tasting coffee than a bamboo filter does.</li>
<li>Don't bother pre-wetting the filter, at least not until you've experimented with more important variables. Pre-wetting will mainly let your water cool down.</li>

<p>I started in the wrong order and bought an espresso machine as the first part but didn't find the coffee I liked. Then I bought a grinder (Rocky) but still didn't find what I was looking for. Lastly, I got a roaster and the magic showed.</p>

<p>The reasons for pucks to be wet is most often that the space between the puck and the group head is too big. When you start pulling the shot, the water is pumped through the group head onto your grounds, filling up the space between the head (more precisely the metal filter) and the puck. The pressure then pushes the water through the grounds, extracting the coffee. When you finish the extraction process there's obviously still water in this chamber and if it's too much it will wet the puck into the sloppy mess you are referring to.</p>

<p>It could be that the basket you are using is too big for the shots you pull or rather that you use too little ground coffee. If it's a single basket you should use about 9-10g of coffee for an espresso with a yield of about 18-20g. However as I said, it's not really a problem if the extraction is ok and the espresso tastes good.</p>

4134,2,,2018-04-09T15:38:43.733,9,,"<p>To answer this shortly, no there is no coffee that has no bitterness. Bitterness in coffee is determined by different factors on which I will elaborate a bit now.</p>

<p>First of all there are bitter substances naturally in coffee. The most obvious and widely known one would be caffein. However in truth only around 15% of the bitterness in coffee comes from caffein. There are hundreds of active substances in coffee, some of which are bitter. Most importantly are chlorogenic acids. They contribute most to the bitterness. So it is unlikely that you will ever find a coffee that has no trace of bitterness at all.</p>

<p>There are however some influenceable factors that contribute to bitterness. I want to address first the roasting process, bean type and origins and then preparation methods and some tweaks that might help.</p>

<h2> 1. <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/9514-chemists-find-coffee-bitter.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Roasting</a></h2>

<p>As I've said before, key to how bitter coffee tastes are the kind of chemical compounds found in it. And the roasting process determines exactly this. When the beans are heated chlorogenic acids are broken down into first acid lactones and later in the roast process into phenylindanes. Chlorogenic acid itself is not bitter, but the compounds it breaks down into are and especially phenylindanes. As they appear later in the roasting, darker roasts tend to be more bitter than light roasts. So my advice here would be to try very light roasted beans. Here's another <a href=""https://www.perfectdailygrind.com/2017/12/bitterness-coffee-always-bad-or-not/"" rel=""noreferrer"">source</a> that also refers to some of the other points I'm making.</p>

<h2>2. Bean type and origin</h2>

<p>There are two main types of Beans, Arabica and Robusta with Robusta containing both much more caffein as well as chlorogenic acids. Thus stay clear of Robusta or mixed coffees, since it will add extra bitterness to your cup. Also in my experience light roasted african coffees, e.g. ethiopean or kenyan coffees are the mildest coffees when it comes to bitterness, but do have more acidity than central or south american coffees. </p>

<h2>3. Preparation methods</h2>

<p>First of all, avoid espresso. Because of the pressure applied to the coffee much more bitter compounds are extracted. A general rule of thumb is that with higher extraction you will extract more bitter compounds, that quickly dominate the flavor of the coffee. The bitter compounds are usually extracted at later stages of the extraction process, thus the shorter your extraction the less bitterness. I would suggest you try pour overs, as extraction can be controlled very well and they are just by design made for a cup of coffee with a brighter, more acidic flavor. V60 or even better a Chemex are your best options. The thick Chemex paper will filter more of the bitter compounds and leave more of the acidic, fruity, floral flavors. There are plenty of instructions on youtube or also here in the forum. Avoid overextraction due to a too small grind size, too high water-grounds contact time and too hot water (around 94°C would be perfect, you can go a bit lower however). Additionally make sure you have a good grinder that produces a consistent particle size. If the variation is too big (the downward variation in this case) and if the grinder produces too many fines (very small coffee particles), they will be over extracted and add bitterness.</p>

<h2>4. Possible tweaks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Adding a pinch of <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/coffee-add-salt-not-sugar-better-flavour-taste-cup-caffeine-bitterness-sodium-a7675916.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">salt</a> to your coffee reduces bitterness.</li>
<li>Use freshly roasted whole bean coffee from your local specialty coffee shop (you can recognize them because they usually offer a variety of pour over methods and have a generally kind of hipstery look) as preground packs of coffee tend to be over-roasted to mask the low quality.</li>
<li>Grind fresh, with a good grinder and even filter out the fines (just sift it through a fine mesh filter)</li>
<li>Lastly you could look for a specialty coffee shop that offers whole light roasted decaf beans. Although caffein only plays a secondary role, it still is bitter and removing it might help reduce bitterness.
Of course there are other factors such as the water for example. However the answers there are not as straightforward and the influence arguably less than the above mentioned ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this can help you in your quest for finding a coffee that you like. I suggest you also go to some local roasters and talk to them. They might be able to help you, suggest coffees etc. and who knows, maybe you can even interest one of them in experimenting with roast profiles that minimize bitterness.</p>

I can't get any hot water stream from the steam wand. </p>

<p>When I put a single basket in the group handle it works. When I put fine or coarse or nothing in the double basket nothing comes out anymore. I have occasionally seen a drop of water coming out over the top when the group handle is in but nothing more so I don't think it's the rubber ring. When I take the group handle out after a failed attempt there is a squeak noise so there definitely water built up under some sort of pressure.

<p>If it's clogged filter you can try soaking it in hot water with an espresso machine cleaning detergent over night. But since you already soaked it in vinegar I don't think that would be fruitful.</p>

<p>You can also, carefully, put the porta filter over a gas stove to burn the residue. Hold it over the flame for a bit until it gets hot enough to burn it, then tap it against your kitchen table or some other heat resistant surface. That should do the trick.

<p>However there are some options I can think of. There are electric Moka pots that have the stove already built into them. Bialetti is the go to brand for Moka pots. I'm certain that they will fit in your office, even on your desk if need be. Alternatively you can get a small electric stove for the Moka pot you already have. It will also fit on your desk.</p>

<p>Another option would be portable espresso makers. Handpresso Wild Hybrid and Wacaco are the only ones I know of.

<p>However I personally would stick with the AeroPress. In my opinion it makes by far better, more complex coffee than the other options.There are also some tweaks, like using two filter papers, using a metal filter, very fine grind size, tamping the coffee, high coffee to water ratio and tweaks/<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIfZ84qtBOc"" rel=""noreferrer"">constructions</a> to apply more pressure, that make a more espresso like drink.

The other tweaks mentioned however can safely increase pressure to a point where you get pretty neat, espresso like results.</p>

Though this is true for anything, even with the Coffee Vaults or plastic storage, if not cleaned properly between uses you will get a different tasting coffee.  The paper and canvas I have also had experiences where the flavor of the canvas or paper starts coming through in the coffee, and I am sure this is also true for some other organic materials.</p>

4147,2,,2018-04-17T17:04:22.457,4,,"<p>Regarding the pre-ground coffee in a French Press, the website, packaging and company all say its suitable for a French Press / Plunger.  Technically it is, the big thing is usually the finer grounds being sifted through the filter and into your cup of coffee.  Most people don't like this, I personally don't mind this, though I do prefer not to have grounds in my coffee.  If you were to grind your own coffee, you may still get some finer particles pushing through, but not as much  </p>

<p>I too use a French Press and I noticed some odd things similar to the oily film when I first started.  I changed a TON of what I was doing, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly what caused that to stop.  Here is a few things.  </p>

<ol>
<li>The grounds of the coffee could be part of that film.  As they sift through, some of the finest particles could be coalescing together and forming what looks like an oily film.<br>
<em>Try different grounds (just for a day, change it up)</em></li>
<li>The appearance of that film could also be due to the sheen of the bean from processing.  Many flavored coffees, even a subtle flavor or a ""non-flavor"" from a large company, are from the beans being in a flavor oil.  This being Lavazza, I see that it tastes like Pralines, which could be some of the flavor of the oil the company uses to mask any bitterness or roasting flavors.  Not all companies do this.<br>
<em>Possibly email company and see if they do add any oil to the coffee (even if its natural or during the roasting process)</em></li>
<li>Check the cleanliness of the french press and coffee cup.  I wasn't washing mine thoroughly enough at the beginning and some of that was a residue from soap I am sure.<br>
<em>Try to fill the french press or coffee cup with water after washing, let sit and see if it produced film</em></li>
<li>Dish Washer and detergent.  I had an apartment that had a dish washer and when it started to ""go"", it would still ""clean"" things but we would notice that everything had a film on it that was pretty much invisible.  We could tell because we would pour a glass of water, then see the film a couple minutes later.  Sometimes it was obvious.  It could also be the detergent in the dish washer.<br>
<em>Try to hand-wash your coffee cup and french press and see if that makes a difference.</em></li>
<li>Check the water.  You may not have control over the water or the quality of the water, but that can play a factor in that oily film.  If the water is not purified or already has a residue, then your coffee will be the same.<br>
<em>Pour a glass of water from the same source and let it sit for 15 minutes and see if you get a film.</em></li>
<li>Bag, packaging and storage.  I have a coffee vault for one of coffee's, and when I ran out and reordered more I put a different bean in there.  The previous bean was flavored and some of the oil from the flavor rubbed off on the sides, which then transferred to the new unflavored beans and caused some oily film.  So again, make sure its washed well.  But also, I noticed some bags or packaging have a metallic looking liner inside the bag, and that I feel is often oily.  I am not sure from what or why, could be a preservative coating or just some oil so there isn't bean on metal contact.  That may also transfer to the bean as well.<br>
<em>Check the inside of the bag and see if that has any oil residue inside.  Also email company see if they coat the inside of their packaging.</em></li>
<li>Lastly, I forgot, but this goes with washing your french press, wash it as soon as you are done.  Out of forgetfulness or laziness I have left my old brew in there overnight a few times, and I have noticed that the next one may have some residue from the previous still, which may be some of that oily film.<br>
<em>Try washing right away after done with coffee</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Espresso capsules are made to be extracted as espressos and lungos, as lungos. The point of this is that Nespresso's lungo coffees are supposedly designed to have a more balanced flavor over a longer extraction/more diluted in contrast to the espresso which was made and evaluated to be drink in a single, stronger shot.</p>

<p>As for myself, I had both ways already and I do believe that at least for the espresso capsules, stick with espresso size (especially if you are using a 3rd party capsule). Nespresso's lungos are often too watery, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Drip brewing and pour-over coffee are essentially the same process:  Pour hot water over ground coffee to extract flavor compounds, then let the infused hot water solution drip through a filter into a serving vessel.  As far as the final product is concerned, it doesn't especially matter if this happens in a machine that dispenses the hot water automatically (drip brewing), or if you pour the water yourself by hand.</p>

<p>The only reason coffee grounds might be suitable for one but not the other would be if you use different filters for drip brewing and pourovers.  For instance, if you have a drip coffee machine that takes paper filters, but a standalone metal mesh filter that you use for pourovers, you would want to use slightly coarser coffee grounds for the latter.  Even in this case, though, the worst possible outcome would be that your coffee might be a little cloudy or gritty, just like if your grounds were slightly too fine (because that's exactly what's happened).</p>

4156,2,,2018-04-23T17:13:55.200,3,,"<p>To answer this it's important to understand what Crema actually is. Roasted coffee consists of somewhere around a thousand different substances, among which are aromatic oils, sugars, caffein, fiber and carbon dioxide trapped inside the beans.</p>

<p>Crema consists mainly of those oils, sugars, some proteins and importantly the CO2 gas trapped inside the bean. When an espresso machine pushes water through the grounds with high pressure, it emulsifies the fats/oils, dissolves some sugars and traps it all in little CO2 bubbles. The CO2 is forced out of the grounds through the high pressure. That's why you have considerably less crema if you use old, stale coffee. Because most of the CO2 trapped inside has evaporated already.</p>

<p>Now to your actual question. For the obvious reason, that is the lack of pressure in a French Press, Crema can not form. There can be some kind of foam, just as with pour overs, but it's not crema. It's not going to last long and will usually dissolve very quickly. If you were to create such a pressure in a French Press (which I highly doubt is technically even possible, since after all you want to brewed coffee to go through the mesh filter, but not the grounds), you would likely have crema forming on the bottom where the grounds settled and then rising to the top, just as it does when you pull a shot of espresso. Order an espresso shot in a transparent shot glass once and observe how the coffee flows out in the beginning as a mixture of coffee and crema and then observe the crema rising to the top, I heard people call it Guinness effect.</p>

4163,2,,2018-04-27T09:53:39.673,2,,"<p>It's just a matter of tradition, style and skill. Traditionally the thick, hard foam with bigger bubbles is used in Italy for Cappuccini. Same goes for espresso macchiato. Sometimes the milk foam is spooned on top of the espresso. In other countries they often imitated italian style coffee, which is why e.g. in Germany the foam is usually very thick as well. In Australia they developed italian coffee culture further and usually froth more silky (and make flat whites with it).</p>

<p>When it comes to skill, it is much harder to produce silky foam than the ""traditional"" foam. You have to start with cold milk, then introduce air at first, but also not too much and lastly spin the milk/foam mixture to break up big bubbles and to work the froth into the milk. In order to do all that you have to get the depth of the spout in the milk right, you have to get the angles right and you have to be careful not to heat the milk too much, because otherwise the foam will become too thick and hard (and the milk will get bitter). For the thicker foam you can basically just put the pitcher under the steam wand, let it sit for a while and come back. Not gonna be pretty what you fine there, but it works.</p>

<p>Third wave and specialty coffee shops usually froth the milk to a silky texture, so called micro foam. That's a different style and there several reasons for it why it is done that way. The most important one is that the taste is superior. Frothed milk above 70 degrees starts tasting bitter. Most specialty coffee barista probably froth the milk to somewhere between 62 and 64 degrees. That way you get a sweet taste and micro-foam. For the thicker foam you would need higher temperatures and thus destroy the taste of the milk.</p>

<p>Regarding the caffeine amount, Wikipedia notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Although less caffeine is extracted with the cold brew method, a higher coffee-to-water ratio is often used, between 2 and 2 1/2 times. This may compensate for this difference in solubility, resulting in a brew with equal, if not more, caffeine (although this is unlikely)</em></p>

<p>Additionally, despite the name, <em>cold brew coffee can be enjoyed hot as well.</em> Cold brew is essentially a coffee concentrate if steeped long enough. You can cut your cold brew with boiling water and serve it hot (<a href=""https://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/how-to-make-cold-brew-coffee/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>), so you don't need to necessarily change the way you enjoy your coffee (if you enjoy it hot). </p>

4170,2,,2018-05-05T01:18:29.270,4,,"<p>Apologies, this is not actually an answer to your question [it's too long for a comment] - but it may be <strong>more</strong> useful to you than the answer to your question:</p>

<p>Crazy as this might sound given everything you've said, I would still suggest that the bitterness may be an integral part of what gives coffee the flavour that you enjoy smelling and having infused in chocolate - it's just that the bitterness needs to be within the right ""flavour context"". Like you, I love the coffee flavour, but cannot empathise with the love of a strong bitter cup of hot coffee that so many people have.</p>

<p>If you wish to enjoy that same coffee flavour on your tongue that you enjoy in your nose, I think the story is basically <em>exactly the same</em> as with chocolate: Pure cocoa has a gorgeously chocolately smell, and yet tastes overwhelmingly bitter; but when the cocoa is thoroughly submerged within a background of <em>both</em> rich dairy-creaminess <em>and</em> high sweetness -- just as in a good bar of milk chocolate -- the bitterness harmonises with the other flavours in such a manner as no longer to be harsh but actually to provide a gentle and pleasant effect, just like the pleasant smell. In this way, the wonderful flavour of cocoa that one can smell can also be tasted on the tongue, in a much clearer manner than if one were just to drink a hot cup of dissolved cocoa powder.</p>

<p>So likewise with coffee. There is simply no version or variant of the standard ""morning cup of coffee"" that you will be able to enjoy the taste of. Rather, you will need it in a different form where it is not only not too strong, but is also blended with a good non-watery dairy flavour and a lot of sweetness. Some possible suggestions:</p>

<p>Certain iced/refrigerated coffee drinks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Many supermarkets sell a drink by Starbucks called ""Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso"" - the potentially misleading name makes it sound like it should be your worst nightmare, but actually you might really like it and not find it bitter-tasting.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of oriental restaurants serve ""iced coffee"", made with sweetened condensed milk. Sometimes (especially in Thai restaurants) the concentration of coffee is quite high, in which case it might still be too bitter for you; but I've been to some Chinese restaurants where the ratios are perfect and it does not feel at all bitter-tasting.</p></li>
<li><p>Some (larger) supermarkets will sell refrigerated ""cappuccino"" drinks made by German manufacturers. For German manufacturers of refrigerated coffee drinks, ""cappuccino"" typically means a good mixture of coffee and chocolate. These can taste really nice. [Edeka's version, if you ever encounter it, is particularly delicious.]</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Solid/dessert forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In my experience, coffee mousse often has a good coffee flavour without feeling bitter-tasting.</p></li>
<li><p>Likewise for coffee gelato (although sometimes this is made with quite a high concentration of coffee, such that it might be too bitter).</p></li>
</ul>

It started making a horrible gear-grinding noise today, after getting a very small, very hard bean stuck in the burrs.  Being physiologically incapable of doing otherwise, I <a href=""https://imgur.com/BzGB6Gv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tore it down</a> to see what had happened.</p>
<p>I was shocked to see that <a href=""https://imgur.com/FFzXL8W"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the (delrin? nylon?) gears</a> actually aren't all chewed up at all.  They were just choked with dirty, messy, nasty, oily grinds, presumably keeping the motor shaft from engaging properly.  I ran the gearbox through the dishwasher to clean it all out, and I think there's hope that this thing will work again when I put it back together.</p>
<p>But I just had a horrible thought:  The gearbox isn't sealed.  Maybe the mess in the gearbox was a combination of grinds and grease.</p>
<p>Thoughts please: should I be packing the gears with silicon grease before I put it all back together?</p>
<p><strong>Update: What I did</strong></p>
<p>I used white lithium grease, after applying foil tape to seal openings between the coffee area and the gearbox area, figuring that there would be a very low likelihood of the grease aerosolizing and getting into the coffee area.</p>

<p>A nice tool to do this could be your French press. After preparing your coffee in a French-press, swiftly clean it and fill it with some milk. Pump the filter in and out for a while. This will inject small air bubbles inside the milk, so the milk quickly turns into textured froth. Then, you can use it as a topping for the previously brewed French-press coffee.</p>

<p>Sometimes, <strong>variety</strong> is confused with single origin. So,  I would like to start with this.</p>

<p>Taxonomically, Coffea genus has several species and we consume three of them as the <em>coffee</em> drink. These three species have several <strong>varieties</strong>. They may be thought as varieties of dog from a biological perspective. Same species, several properties.</p>

<p>For coffee though, the variety is not the only criteria that affects the quality of a bean. Cultivation, climate, soil, irrigation, harvesting, drying and peeling the fruit from the bean,  drying the bean are all affect the bean quality. So, if you have a specific <em>variety</em> and also you can guarantee the region and the aforementioned process is stable for a batch of beans, you call them <strong>single origin</strong> beans.</p>

<p><strong>Blends</strong> are ""blends"" of several single origin coffee beans to produce the flavor characteristics of more than one single origin coffee. For a recent related post on blends please check this: </p>

<p>The reason I think it would make a difference is because the heat would make lots of the alcohol evaporate. So by adding it after the cream you actually get more alcohol in your coffee (and more alcohol soluble flavors). </p>

4185,2,,2018-05-11T10:24:49.300,3,,"<p>An Irish coffee is traditionally a strong sweetened (with muscovada or demerara sugar or syrup) coffee with a doubleshot of Whisky (I guess around 40-50ml for a glass of coffee of 150ml) and a layer of aerated cream on top of it.</p>

<ol>
<li>The coffee</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know what was used traditionally, I assume some kind of turkish coffee (or ""Cowboy coffee""), where the grounds steep in water just of the boil for a few minutes or percolater coffee. Today I would probably use french press coffee or AeroPress with a metal disk instead of paper filter. You should keep in mind, that the coffee-sugar-whisky mix has to be higher in density than the slightly whipped cream. A pour over is likely too delicate (in taste and density). You also don't want coffee that's too strong (like espresso) because it would cover up most of the Whisky taste. Irish whisky tends to be lighter than Scotch or Bourbon. Add brown sugar to taste, but keep in mind that it is used to increase the density of the coffee-whisky mix as well, so one tablespoon should be added (for a glass of coffee as defined before).</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Whiskey</li>
</ol>

<p>Well it's called Irish coffee, so I would use Irish whisky. However I'm sure it's worth experimenting with different whiskys, trying to fit them to the flavor profile of the coffee. If you have a very nutty, chocolaty Brazilian coffee, maybe a smoky, spicy Bourbon fits better. I don't know much about whisky though. I'd just try different things. If you are afraid of too much alcohol evaporating, you could just wait until the coffee is cooled down to below 79°C. You can't drink it before that anyways, it would be too hot. After brewing, add sugar to cool it down, then I would wait until it's somewhere around 75°C, add the whisky, which will cool it down even further. Guessing to just below 70°C. Add cream and drink.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Cream</li>
</ol>

<p>As said before, the cream should float on top without mixing with the coffee. Thus it has to be added after, which is usually done over the back of a spoon. It should be whipped lightly, but not too much either. You want it to be of a creamy, slightly aerated consistency. You drink the coffee through the cream.</p>

However, the flavoured coffee they have ""on tap"" are completely unsweetened, which is what I seek.  I've done some initial web scouting for syrups, but it's not always easy to ferrut out a complete ingredients list.  Though I have come across lists such as ""other ingredients"" below the nutrition table.  Not too sure how to interpret that, as I do not view the nutritional table as an ingredients list at all.  Many syrups are general-purpose rather than being meant for coffee.</p>

<p>Rather than continue running down what seems like a high ratio of information dead ends, I'm hoping to leverage the awareness of those who already enjoy healthy coffee flavouring syrups that are completely unsweetened.  Even slightly sweetened would be fine, as long as it doesn't consist of recently developed     alternative sweeteners, even of the all-natural variety (I want to avoid accusations of slagging products by mentioning names).  <strong>If you are able to divulge what your syrup is, I'd appreciate it.</strong>  If you can provide the ingredients and/or nutritional info, either as text, photos, or URLs, so much the better.</p>

<p>From my attempts to inquire about suitable syrups in decades past, I suspect and hope that there are few candidate options that (i) are targeted to coffee; (ii) are completely (or almost completely) unsweetened; and (iii) have their ingredients (and maybe the nutrition) list available online.  If so, then this question is not nearly as open-ended as it may seem at first glance.</p>

<p>Caffeine is highly soluble, yes. But, also the other lipids and aromatics, too. So, you cannot obtain the benefits of <em>specialty coffee</em> if you ruin that first brew. The main taste we gain from coffee grounds are received from the soluble aromatic oils in the coffee. You don't want to loose them by pouring.</p>

<p>Normally, decaffeination process is made when the beans are green. That's why the aromatics are kept inside the beans when the beans are over-hydrated and then dried (in the Swiss process, which is the common way recently) a few times in a cycle to near completely remove the caffeine.</p>

The root of Arabic word is unknown, but some say that it is originated from some poetic form of a word for wine as it is forbidden in the Arabic world. This name is more or less similar all around the world today: Turkish kahve, French cafe, Italian caffe, German kaffee, Dutch koffie, English coffee, Latin coffea.</p>

<p>The wild Coffea arabica is known to be cultivated in Harar valley of Ethiopia at earliest AD 850.</p>

<p>The beverage stayed local for a while, then became known among Arabs. East Europe became aware of it through Ottomans; Especially Austria and Italy. Then, the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Coffee was a very valuable asset even in those years. Therefore, strangers were not allowed to access green beans for long in the Arabian peninsula. Baba Budan, an Indian Pilgrim, was the first one who can manage to take out seven coffee seeds out of Mecca to Mysore strapped to his belly.

So it should be easy to pick one that's close to you.</p>

<p>Other than that vietnamese coffee is of the Robusta species and the roast profile is quite dark. So you can also just go to a well sorted supermarket and buy a pack of Robusta dark roast beans/grounds, preferably of vietnamese origin. It will be more or less the same as the coffee roasted by vietnamese roasters.</p>

<p>One study by Akthar et al. (1999) showed that the ingestion of 250mg of caffein, which corresponds to 2 to 3 cups of coffee, produced alteration in the voice of 8 individuals. I would take this result with a grain of salt though, since a study performed with only 8 subjects, without control group or anything, can hardly be called representative or conclusive in any way. Also they say that the effect produced varied substantially between individuals.</p>

<p>Another study by Franca et al. (2013) is showing that the ingestion of 100mg of caffein shortly before using your voice does not have any negative effect on the quality of your voice. I think this is a more plausible study design, 100mg corresponds to a cup of coffee and the experiment is controlled with one group taking placebos.</p>

<p>Finally a recent review (Alves et al. 2017) of the literature on dehydration and vocal quality found that dehydration is, surprise, bad for your voice. They also found however that ""systematic hydration is the easiest [...] solution to improve voice quality"".</p>

<p>Thus I would conclude, that as long as you take care to stay hydrated, meaning drinking water with your coffee (which everyone should do in any case) moderate amounts of coffee consumption will likely not have any detrimental effect on your voice quality. The evidence for that seems to be mainly anecdotal and not scientific. If you struggle with some vocal chord disease for example or you are in recovery of one, maybe coffee could be ill-advised. Akthar et al. (1999) hint to something like that. There's no proof that it's damaging in those cases either, but just for the sake of being overly careful rather than ending up doing damage (anyways it would likely be only temporary) to your voice, if you are professionally dependent on it, maybe restrain from coffee consumption in cases of diseases etc.</p>

<p>Understandably, you probably enjoy being charged during the week so you're always effective at everything you do. But it seems here that you need to reduce your intake so you do not experience this on weekends. </p>

<p>There are a few ways to do this without losing that all important energy during your weekday. One such method is to try drinking a <a href=""https://blog.bulletproof.com/how-to-make-butter-coffee-bulletproof/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bulletproof Coffee</a>. This is a technique used by many involving <em>Grass-fed Cow</em> Butter, which reportedly will increase the effects of caffeine making it last much longer. This is due to the butter making the caffeine release slowly in your system rather than all in one go. Other methods revolving around the same principle involve the use of <em>Extra Virgin Raw Coconut Oil</em> which also has similar effects to the butter, but then also contains essential dietary fats and provides your brain with whats known as <a href=""https://www.alzdiscovery.org/cognitive-vitality/ratings/medium-chain-triglycerides"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Medium Chain Triglycerides</em></a> (MCT).</p>

<p>MCT is <em>converted to keytones in your body</em> which then is provided as energy to the brain. This is all good stuff to have in conjuntion with your coffee, as it's likely to help you reduce your intake. A raw tablespoon of it in the morning is also likely to have a <a href=""http://www.naturallivingideas.com/eat-coconut-oil/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">beneficial effect on your brain</a> during the weekends too, so that may help with the headaches. An added bonus is that it whitens the teeth if held in the mouth for a short time before swallowing, which is also a good counter to the tooth staining effects of our favourite bev!</p>

Not how as in the French press vs drip, nor how as in what goes into it (cream and sugars), nor the type of roast or flavor and such.  Rather is this a first thing in the morning before you get dressed, or is it on your way to work, or something else.</p>

<p>A thought that I had that helps/helped me is to withhold the coffee for a bit.  I don't drink it to wake up or right away in the morning.  I drink it to enjoy things.
  I make sure I have a cup of water or two first, then I get my fresh cup of coffee.<br>
I also typically try not to have it in the first 1.5 hours of waking up to make sure there is no dependency on it to wake up.
  I am a creature of habit as many are, but I will try to change it up once in a while.<br>
I also make sure that after a certain hour I don't have anymore.  If I do, I don't make a habit of that and try to limit what I have that day or the next as a total.  It doesn't always work.
I also try to enjoy the coffee for the flavor, and not the caffeine rush.  If you need the caffeine rush, try Jolt Cola or Mountain Dew first thing.  Just kidding.</p>

<p>Last, I try but definitely not successful, but I read an article about drinking coffee and your circadian rhythm.  It makes sense and worth a shot.  But the recommendation is to try to drink coffee only when your cycle or rhythm is high to avoid that dependency during the lows.</p>

<p>This all really helped me and I see many people that drink to drink caffeine or drink to wake up.  Keep all that in mind, and some of this might not be possible for everyone either.  Some may not have access to coffee after they leave their house, others it may be out of budget to get coffee elsewhere or through a different means (thus shifting the schedule and how / why you get coffee).
  It also helped me a little to switch to a French press and a hand grinder.  Even if I wanted it right away first thing in the morning, I need to boil water, grind the coffee, let it steep then plunge and enjoy...it's not a long or difficult process but it's not instant and helps me wait and be patient to get my fix.</p>

<p><strong>I can easily say that it is not based on caffeine</strong>, as the most stronger one is an Arabica peaberry. If it was based on caffeine amount, it should be a Robusta instead of an Arabica. We know that being a peaberry bean or not does not really influence the caffeine amount.</p>

<p>Viennese blend is probably a Viennese roast. Also, an espresso blend is a quite dark roast to decrease the acidity of the overall blend. The reason is, the espresso preparation technique is known to add additional acidity to the final cup of coffee. So, roasters prepare a bit more darker roasts to decrease the acidity for coffee that will be used for espresso.</p>

4240,2,,2018-06-19T10:09:21.170,1,,"<p>The Bialetti Brikka comes in two varieties. The 2- and 4-cup edition. The water chamber of the 2-cup edition is 100ml and the 4-cup has 200ml volume water chamber.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely certain which measuring cup you are referring to though. Bialetti offers a <a href=""https://www.bialetti.com/coffee/accessories/coffee-scoop-clip-c-1_10_139.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">measuring spoon</a>. However they don't explicitly state the volume of it, so a best guess would be to use a standard ""spoon"" volume, which is approximately 15ml.</p>

<p>You may be referring to the coffee chamber, which you put, filled with ground coffee of course, into the brewing device. There is also no specification of volume, however the diameter is know and given by Bialetti. <a href=""https://www.bialetti.com/coffee/replacement-parts/funnel-c-1_73_75.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The funnel</a> of the 2-cup Brikka is exactly 2 3/8 inches wide (roughly 6cm). Guessing that the height of the funnel (without the spout) should be roughly a bit over half of that (3.5cm maybe judging only by looking at it, so it may be off), the volume of the gasket would be around 100ml as well, calculating the volume of a cylinder. This doesn't account for the fact, that the bottom of the cylinder is slightly convex, but since I don't have a Brikka at hand right now, we are kind of in the guessing game anyways.</p>

<p>However one more thing. To use a Bialetti stove top you don't need any measuring spoon anyways. You just fill the funnel with coffee until it's completely full without tamping. Then you fill the water chamber just right below the safety valve, you screw the top on and you are good to go. The ratios are basically of fixed by design.</p>

4241,2,,2018-06-19T11:19:30.883,4,,"<p>Making coffee is all about extraction. The compounds you find in coffee beans that add flavor dissolve at different moments of the process. Some dissolve almost instantly when the coffee grounds come in contact with water. Like for example caffein and the more acidic compounds. Others take a while before the water dissolves them, like bitter compounds and sugars. The goal is to have an even extraction. To get the best possible flavor out of the coffee. You want some sugars in there to give it sweetness, but you don't want too much bitterness. You want fruitiness and acidity, but you don't want it as sour as lemon juice. So you need to balance the extraction.</p>

<p>There are different variables influencing this process, but they all come down to how fast and much extraction is happening. The grind size, the water temperature (and mineral content) and the brewing time just to name the most important ones.</p>

<p>Wetting the grounds, or blooming, is preparing them for the extraction. When coffee is roasted CO2 gas is trapped inside the beans. Wetting the grounds, without water passing through the filter (for drip coffee where blooming is most important, certainly more than for full immersion techniques like French press) has the effect of the CO2 being released to ensure an even extraction when you are brewing. There are several straight forward reasons for that and some more technical ones.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Blooming prevents channeling of the water (the phenomena that all the water will flow through small holes of grounds instead of saturating all of them)</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't bloom the gas in the beans will bubble upwards pushing the water away from the grounds which results in channeling and uneven extraction of the particles that are trapped inside the gas bubbles.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine your grind, it's made up of particles of different sizes with most of them somewhere hovering around the size you actually wanted. So when you start pouring water without blooming the small particles will soak up the water faster than the bigger ones and will obviously start extracting earlier. In the end that will result in over extracted small particles and very under extracted bigger particles. By pre infusing the grounds you even that out a little bit. By adding just enough water to infuse all of the grounds without already extracting, you start from a more even level. The smaller particles will still extract more than the bigger ones, but the extraction levels are evened out, because the starting point is more leveled and extraction begins at the same moment for all grounds.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>""Why should I pour remaining water in batches anyway?""</p>

<p>This is more a matter of style. Some Baristi prefer it that way and others pour continuously. More important is that you don't brew excessively long or short. Between 2,5 min. and 3 min. is a good time (for Hario V60, different for other pour over methods). Some say that pouring in batches helps being consistent, but it's not something that's necessary. I brew very consistent (measurably with a refractometer that measures total dissolved solids or TDS) and I pour continuously.</p>

<p>As far as I know, historically Indians realize that tea and coffee includes many active radicals at the early ages just by observation.

That's why Indians have this kind of coffee as well as <em>Chai Latte</em>.</p>

4249,2,,2018-06-20T19:14:39.633,2,,"<p>Your sieve method and the French press are very similar, so with the current parameters you can expect a similarly flavor profile.</p>

<p>But:<br>
If you complain that your current setup strains improperly, I suspect that unless your sieve is really wide-meshed, your grind is too fine and will be even more so for the French press.</p>

<p>French presses have a relatively coarse mesh “filter” (more like a sieve), so if you combine a French press with too-finely ground coffee, you will invariably get coffee grounds and a cloudy brew in your cup. The general advice is to use a coarser grind for French press than for filter, not to mention the fine to super-fine grinds of the espresso and Turkish mokka types. </p>

<p>But if you have coarser grounds, you need a longer extraction time (compare 30 seconds for espresso with 2-4 minutes for French press) to get enough overall “flavor” out. The different flavor components have different extraction curves, and this is one of the main reasons why roasters sell different roasts - they are adapted to the parameters of the brewing method. </p>

<p>My suggestion: Try your press with the current coffee. If it’s too cloudy or grainy (which I think is likely), try a coarser grind and play with the parameters like time and roast. If you want a truly “clean” or “clear” cup, all methods with coarse sieves are at a disadvantage and you are likely to get better results with true filters. They use a pour-over technique, which is similar (albeit not identical) to your current full-immersion method. </p>

4257,2,,2018-06-26T09:56:20.197,2,,"<p>This is correct and it has a reason. Actually three. Let me explain...</p>

<p>First, I want you to consider the shape of the Hario Buono Coffee Drip Kettle:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfGZ2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QfGZ2.jpg"" alt=""Hario Buono Coffee Drip Kettle""></a></p>

<p>Or, a Turkish tea kettle:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lj51z.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lj51z.jpg"" alt=""Turkish tea kettle""></a></p>

<p>As you can clearly see, both have separate spouts. The special design of the spout make the flow of the liquid as <em>laminar</em> as possible while you pour it.</p>

<p>This is our first concern, why don't coffee carafes don't have this special spout that starts from the bottom, makes a curve and ends at the top, apart from the body of the carafe?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In that case, the coffee at rest in the spout will loose so much heat and become cold rapidly. This is not what we desire. We want the coffee carafes to keep heat as stable as possible. So, we want to keep coffee all together, apiece, in one place together. That's why, coffee carafes have only one (not very nice) spout at the top. This is our first reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Here comes our second one, for liquids, or in general for fluids, you have a magic number, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reynolds number</a>. This number is (simply) kind of the ratio in between how particles are carried by the total motion of the coffee (inertial forces) and the resistance against being carried (viscous forces). When inertial forces are too much against viscous forces, your coffee starts to tremble by definition. This is what happens when you start to pour your coffee. Apparently, when the angle in between the carafe's spout and the vertical to the earth's gravitational vector is close to 90 degrees, Reynolds number will be bigger than when it is close to 0 degrees. This explains why emptier carafes have more laminar flow during pouring.</p></li>
<li><p>And finally, the third. Fluids also have another magic number called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_number"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Weber number</a>. This number explains why surface tension effects your pouring. As in the previous case, also surface tension adds an extra complexity to the flow while you pour with greater degrees. The surface tension forces your coffee to form droplets. As a result, instead of having a perfect laminar flow, you end up a turbulent and sometimes intermittent with droplets flow while you try to pour when your carafe is full.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are also a few other interesting concepts like Ohnesorge number and others. But I hope these could explain it all.</p>

<p>Outside of grinding the coffee and putting in the correct amount of water a drip coffee does not require much work or attention.</p>

<p>So, if you're providing espresso for your customers you need a far more expensive grinder, an expensive and finicky machine (the espresso maker) an employee who has had to undergo far more extensive training and said employee needs to be paying attention to what he is doing for each and every cup of espresso he is making.</p>

<p>All this adds to increased cost. Plus customers are willing to wait, and pay a few cents more for an espresso done right. As opposed to paying less and having an espresso in name only.</p>

4260,2,,2018-07-01T10:37:03.130,2,,"<p>In a stove top coffee maker the water is boiled in the lower chamber, the steam pushes the water at low pressure upwards through the grounds before reaching the upper chamber, let's call it decanter. So the water is in contact with the grounds only once. Due to the high temperature there is arguably over extraction happening. In terms of flavor you can tell by the slightly bitter taste. Another factor contributing to this is that the fines are flushed out with the water, ending up in the decanter and your cup where they keep extracting bitter compounds. This can be minimized using some tweaks, but it's not preventable.</p>

<p>A percolator in comparison keeps circulating the water and brewed coffee through the grounds, reaching an even higher extraction ratio. The water and continuously the brewed coffee is heated, pushed upwards and ""dropped"" on the grounds before it sinks down towards the heat source again.</p>

<p>The difference in taste stems from the rules of extraction. The first substances to be extracted are caffein and acids. Caffein is bitter, but adds only partly to the bitterness in coffee compared to other compounds extracted later. The acids give coffee fruitiness, which is usually a desired quality and forms the base of the taste profile. The bitter compounds and sugars are extracted last. You want mainly the sugars in your cup to add sweetness, the bitter compounds you want to avoid. They make the coffee taste hollow, ashy, a bit like charcoal or burned rubber and leaves you with a kind of empty feeling after swallowing it. By that I mean it has no pleasant lingering after taste.</p>

<p>So basically that is what's happening with percolators. They over extract, meaning too many of the bitter compounds get in your coffee, which makes it unbalanced and just overall not really tasty. I would say it's probably one of the worst methods out there to make coffee nowadays in terms of extraction. There is of course a subjective component to it. Some people might enjoy exactly this taste. Maybe they want that burned taste, then add lots of sugar, milk and/or flavors and that's just what they like. That's of course ok, but the facts remain, that you lose complexity, fruitiness and sweetness.</p>

4262,2,,2018-07-02T07:25:54.010,3,,"<p>It is a common misconception to think that a Moka Pot can make espresso like coffee. Espresso machines use up to 9 bars of pressure to push the water through the grounds. The Moka Pot only creates around 1,5 bar of pressure (for comparison, the pressure of your tap water lies probably between 3 and 6 bar). It is simply impossible to get anything close to an espresso (although it is often considered to be the closest espresso alternative without an expensive machine supposedly due to the residue coffee in your cup that gives it a slightly similar mouthfeel and body).</p>

<p>You can try to use very finely ground coffee, but that's about the only thing and it still won't make you an espresso. For that you need to invest in a machine. The good ones start at 500$/€. You can of course buy one for 100$/€, but they are not worth the money in my opinion. Tamping and other tweaks are not recommended because you might block the water from passing through the grounds, building up pressure until it is explosively released. If you are lucky through the pressure valve, but I've seen a Bialetti literally ""erupt"", spraying coffee through the entire kitchen and several meters high to the ceiling (slightly more than 3m to be precise, because that's the height of the ceiling where to coffee eruption came to a forceful halt).</p>

4265,2,,2018-07-02T10:44:12.590,4,,"<p>To answer your question properly it is necessary to explain what coffee beans actually consist of. Around 50% of the coffee bean are carbohydrates, some of them soluble (like sucrose), but most of them are not (they add to body and mouthfeel though as non soluble substances in your cup). Other important parts are acids, such as chlorogenic acid, fatty acids, caffein obviously, proteins and other volatile flavor compounds. There are around 1000 of these volatile flavor compounds.</p>

<p>When the beans are roasted CO2 gas is developed and stored inside the bean. It's a natural oxidation inhibitor as it prevents oxygen from reaching the bean. When you are grinding the beans almost immediately most of the CO2 gas is exhausted. Simultaneously the surface area of the bean is exponentially increased. That means that oxygen has a much larger surface area to ""attack"" plus the gas protecting these volatile flavor compounds vanishes almost instantly.</p>

<p>Oxidation starts and in 15min. around 60% of these the volatile flavor compounds are evaporated. That is why most pre ground coffee beans smell almost identical when you open the packages, independently of the bean origin. What remains as flavorful compounds are the proteins, that have mostly undergone Maillard reactions, making them rather bitter, the sucrose, caffein and some acids like chlorogenic acid. All beans (Arabica) contain those in more or less the same quantities. The flavor compounds that contribute to origin specific flavors are mostly gone by the time you open up a package of preground coffee.</p>

<p>Thus to answer your question, coffee goes stale almost immediately after grinding. The coffee in the packages you buy in the supermarket is pretty much already stale when they pack it in the factories. Hence you can probably keep an unopened package for about a year before you will note further significant impacts on the flavor, it will just keep getting more bitter as oxidation continues.</p>

I remember when I did my barista course I was doing great with milk texturing on various machines then was put on a machine which was doing something very similar to today. For anyone that uses these machines for a living, is there something that can cause this? Pressure too high perhaps? Or operator error? Although I doubt the last, I tried literally everything. I did notice it had a very small wand so I had trouble submerging it very far, but far enough that I was introducing air. </p>

The question is, how small and consistent you should crack them to pieces. This is important as it affects the extraction of the coffee, so your cup.

</ul>

<p>And, what about the right size? It should be about 400 microns for a drip machine that uses filter size grounds. But, don't worry. Coffee shops know about these. All you need to do is just ask for it or read the labels. Here is a quick chart for all coffee brewing methods and ground sizes:</p>

<p>If you purchase packaged coffee, which is not labeled as 100% Arabica, you are mostly buying from 10% to 30% Robusta.</p>

<p>Still, I would like to add, some quality Robusta's (especially Africans) may be superior to not so good Arabica's.</p>

<p>Again, the ratio of Robusta may go up to 50% in some house blends or horeca blends. You may even consume pure Robusta in Indonesia or in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Different brewing methods require <a href=""https://www.homegrounds.co/coffee-grind-chart/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">different grind sizes</a>. To categorize it roughly. From small to large with the smallest size (extra fine) corresponding to a flour like texture and the largest size (extra coarse) corresponding to crushed pepper:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Extra fine:</strong> Turkish coffee</li>
<li><strong>Fine:</strong> Espresso or Mokka/stove-top coffee (most pre-ground coffee is this size)</li>
<li><strong>Medium-Fine:</strong> Filter coffee such as V60/Kalita or AeroPress</li>
<li><strong>Medium:</strong> Filter coffee such as Chemex/Clever Dripper or Filter coffee such as V60/Kalita or AeroPress</li>
<li><strong>Medium-coarse:</strong> Filter coffee such as Chemex or Batch Brewers such as Mokkamaster or AeroPress</li>
<li><strong>Coarse:</strong> French Press or AeroPress</li>
<li><strong>Extra coarse:</strong> Cold brew maybe in Toddy systems or maybe cowboy coffee and similar things.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see these categories are not fixed, since grind size is only one of many variables that influence the coffee extraction (among them time and temperature). The AeroPress exemplifies that best as you can vary the grind size significantly and still produce balanced cups, although with different flavor focuses depending on the grind size. For paper filter systems depending on the system you should not grind to fine since the paper gets clocked and the coffee doesn't drain properly anymore. Similarly don't grind to large as the water would flow through to quickly.</p>

<p>For you the most relevant will be medium-fine to medium grinds as that will be the size commonly sold as filter grind in supermarkets. In a specialized coffee shop the size they will grind you their coffee to (if you buy it there) may differ from that in supermarkets, but they will usually give you recommendations and tips on how to use it with your specific filter coffee machine. Depending on which one you have, a medium-coarse grind might produce better results. Although that is likely not what they mean when they write filter ground coffee, if it is a common household machine from a standard home appliances store.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong>
So when the espresso begins to pour, the pressure is not high enought, and the color is dark. It takes about 3-5 seconds to reach the right presure and the right color. </p>

<p><strong>So what can I do to get the right pressure when the espresso begins to pour out?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The equitment I'm using is:</strong></p>

<p>Machine: Sage Barista express</p>

<p>Grinder: Mahlkönig Vario grinder (Right now the grind size i'm using is 3.d)</p>

<p>The beans roasting date: 19/06.</p>

<p>I'm using about 16g of grind coffee.</p>

<p>I'm Tamping at about 15kg</p>

<p>The extraction time is about 22.4 secound from I press the 'double shot' button.</p>

<p><strong>What I have tried:</strong></p>

<p>If I try to use a finer grind the pressure will just get way to high, but still use about 3-5 secound to reach espresso range.</p>

<p>If I try to use a coarser grind the pressure will never reach the espresso range.</p>

4280,2,,2018-07-12T06:07:40.130,4,,"<p><strong>This is completely normal, this is the pre-infusion phase.</strong></p>

<p>Pre-infusion is used to wet the grounds before starting ideal espresso extraction. Wetting with hot water helps the grounds to release initial CO<sub>2</sub>, therefore enables more and even extraction surface. <em>It somewhat resembles blooming in pour-over manual filtering.</em></p>

<p>As a result, you should feel lucky that you have this feature on your machine. By the way, I take a look and found this explanation on <a href=""https://sageappliances.co.uk/products/barista-express?variant=40400693188"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sage's website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pre Infusion Function:
  Gradually increases water pressure to gently expand grinds for an even extraction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>And a final note to enhance your cup of espresso...</strong></p>

<p>As I can  see, you end up in 22.4 - 5 = 17.4 seconds, which is pretty fast. The common practice is 1 ml in 1 second; therefore you should fill a 30 ml espresso in 30 seconds (with double spouts a doppio will take the same amount of time 60 ml in 30 seconds.) I recommend you try to fix timing first to see if you can get better results.</p>

<p>When using glassware during brewing as in French-press, V60 or Chemex, it is important to warm up the gadgets prior to brewing. Normally, the water temperature is set just below boiling point (around 95 degrees Celsius) for a good brew. When you start with cold glassware, your nicely prepared close-to-boiling-point water may cool down a few degrees, which is crucial in the taste of the final cup of coffee.</p>

<p><em>Additional note:</em> Moreover, after brewing, pouring the prepared coffee to a cold cup may decrease the temperature a few additional degrees, which renders your beverage at most warm, instead of hot.  This is mostly visible in espresso as its volume is relatively small. As a result, it is also recommended to keep the cups warmed. Some home espresso machines have additional heating trays on top to keep the cups warm before pulling an espresso shot.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with your milk foam because of the small bubbles on the surface, then try to ""bump"" the pitcher (knock the table with the pitcher). It will remove the bubbles and it will make foam more uniform.</p>

<p>""My espresso and its crema do not seem dark enough to produce the contrast in colours you find in good latte art from a cafe.""</p>

<p>The answer is classic: fresh ground coffee (better use real burr grinder), with some robusta (20-30% it gives better crema), for darker color just find proper beans (you can try to buy beans in the coffee shop to compare your result with their result)</p>

<p>""I cannot seem to get the coffee and the milk to as hot a temperature as you get in a cafe - even if I pre-heat my cup. Could this because many cafes serve their coffee too hot?""</p>

4294,2,,2018-07-25T17:02:29.510,4,,"<p>There are generally speaking two categories of processing methods and some hybrids of the two. You will often see either washed coffee or natural coffee.</p>

<p><strong>1. Washed coffee</strong></p>

<p>Washing is the newer method, usually applied in humid countries as dry processing is prone to cause mold there and has been considered the gold standard in terms of flavor since the industrialization of coffee production. For traditional small scale farmers however it's not been viable due to the high investment and maintenance costs and the need for electricity (change of organization to cooperative forms has mitigated this somewhat). In this processing method the coffee cherry is completely depulped (mechanically and through up to 36h fermentation in water) before the bean is dried. The pulp, mucilage and parchment skin is removed. Only some of the silver skin stays on the bean in this way of processing and falls off during roasting as chaff. Usually there are some chaff leftovers in the crack after roasting, which is a way to tell apart washed and natural processed coffees. Washed coffee is very true to the taste of the variety/cultivar. Only the actual coffee bean gives flavor. Washed coffee is all else equal generally more acidic and has brighter fruit flavors than natural coffee.</p>

<p><strong>2. Dry processed / natural coffee</strong></p>

<p>Dry processing is the ""natural"", traditional method to process coffee and still dominant in Ethiopia (although washed becomes more popular) and especially in Brazil, where basically all coffee is dry processed. The cherries are dried in the sun for about 4 to 6 weeks on flat beds leaving the skin, pulp and mucilage on the bean. Only after the drying is complete the cherry being hulled (that means the pulp, mucilage and parchment skin removed). During the drying the cherry is fermenting and some of the sugars and flavors of the mucilage, the fruit, are transferring to the bean. So you tend to get different flavors than with washed coffee. The coffee usually is fuller bodied, has more red fruit notes like strawberry, cherry and is higher in sugar content because some of the sugars from the mucilage transfer to the bean during the drying.</p>

<p><strong>3. Hybrid methods / Semi-Washed / Honey processing</strong></p>

<p>Recently some producers started combining washed and dry processes. Here the cherry is partly depulped, leaving the mucilage on.
There are different stages that are differentiated by the amount of mucilage left on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Red honey: all the mucilage is left on for the drying process, the bean turns red, thus the name.</li>
<li>Yellow honey: only a small part of the mucilage is left on for drying and the beans turn yellow.</li>
<li>White honey: almost all the mucilage is removed, it's closest to washed coffee and there's no discoloring of the beans.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other variations due to the rise in specialty coffee and as producers get more creative and experimental.

<p>You plug those values into the following two equations to get extraction percent:</p>

<p>TDS% x Brewed Coffee Mass = Extracted Mass</p>

<p>Extraction% = (Extracted Mass) / (Dry Mass)</p>

<p>So, my question is: how do you get brewed coffee mass?  Do you have to take out your mug before you start everything and then weigh the solution afterwards?  </p>

<p>Also, is it necessary to have a refractometer to calculate the TDS?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Total dissolved solids: You will have to measure this using a refractometer. There are many out there, for commercial settings they start at around 300€. I have no experience with cheaper, ""home use"" refractometers but I'd assume they lack accuracy. </p></li>

<li><p>Brewed coffee mass: As in 2. you will have to weigh your brew. Tar your kitchen scale with the cup on it, brew coffee and put the cup back. Voila.</p></li>

<p>Now you just all pluck it in the equation and you are good to go. Suppose you have 15g of ground coffee, yield 190g of brewed coffee with a TDS of 1,3%, which is great for a pour over.</p>

<p>That gives you an extracted mass of 2,47g.</p>

<p>2,47g/15g = 0.165. So the extraction % would be 16,5%.</p>

<p>I assume, the original question here is: <em>How does one calculate extraction percent?</em> If this is the question, the answer is simply a refractometer as it directly reads the extraction percent.</p>

<p>However, the main problem is what could you do if you don't have a refractometer, or you are not assured with the quality of your refractometer. This boils down the subquestion: <em>is it necessary to have a refractometer to calculate the TDS?</em></p>

<p>Actually, before the invention of refractometers (the device that checks the opacity of a liquid, so it could reason how many irregularities exists in it), chemists were able to calculate total dissolved solids in a solution by simple methods. I will explain one here. That, you can make at home without precision. And repeat at a lab environment with high precision.</p>

<p><strong>The methodology</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Find a very thin, light heat-resistant glass, preferably a Petri dish. Put it on (precision) scale and zero your scale.</li>
<li>Put a fair amount of (say, 10 grams) brewed coffee in the Petri dish while it is on the scale.</li>
<li>Place the Petri dish in the stove, set it to 100 °C. Wait until all water vaporizes and coffee remains dry out completely.</li>
<li>Put the Petri dish on the scale again. You have weighted the total dissolved solids.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, you now have all the required mass you need for your formulas.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Be careful to be clean at all points. E.g. your sweat prints, etc. may affect the weight as the mass will be fairly small.</li>
<li>Your accuracy increases while the weight of Petri dish decreases and the amount of brewed coffee used in this method increases.</li>
<li>Use a scale as precise as possible.</li>
<li>This methodology cannot weight the aromatic oils as everything vaporizes. However, by definition TDS does not include aromatic oils. So, I don't care about them that much.</li>

Am I cutting off the heat too early? Or is this some kind of issue with the pot I'm using? Let me know what you think. </p>

4300,2,,2018-07-30T21:41:22.177,2,,"<p><strong>Probably yes, prematurely cut down heat may be the reason.</strong></p>

<p>During normal operation of a moka pot, all of the water filled in the bottom chamber evaporates and flows through the top chamber through the coffee grounds. If the level of the filled water is not above the marked safety level you can safely wait to be sure till all of the water evaporates. You can understand this easily as bubbling sounds end and you can only hear a stable hissing sound.</p>

<p>When heat is cut off prematurely some vapor may form droplets in the middle chamber and may flow back to the bottom chamber. However, it should be lightly brewed and the amount should be really small. If this is not the case, your pot may have a leak somewhere.</p>

<p>One last option, which is not clear from your question is, whether you mention coffee solution in the bottom chamber or ground coffee particles. If you observe ground coffee particles either in the top or bottom chamber, it indicates that the grounds are too fine for a moka pot. You should ask your roastery to grind them coarser.</p>

4301,2,,2018-07-31T02:46:53.560,4,,"<p>I think you are on the right track with your idea. To understand what's happening you need to understand how the moka pot works and how to correctly use it. I'll explain it here quickly but there are some nice illustrations on how it works on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia entry</a> for it.</p>

<p>First, the heat should be cut off once you hear the first hissing sound. That is when all the water has been pushed through the ground coffee and the brew is ready. By construction there remains a little bit of water in the bottom chamber. That is because the spout of the filter basket doesn't go all the way to the bottom of the chamber.</p>

<p>When the water starts boiling, the steam of the evaporated water pressurizes the chamber between 1,5 and max. 3 bar (that is the pressure the safety valve sustains without opening) depending on the grind size of your coffee, the amount of coffee and if you tamp it (which you should not). The gas pressurizes the area above the water, which pushes the water through the spout, through the ground coffee and into the top part until the water level is so low that the steam exits through the spout. That's the hissing sound. So one of two things could be happening here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There might still be a lot of water in the ""brewing chamber"", where the ground coffee is, when you cut off the heat. Then the pressure in the bottom chamber will fall and the coffee in the middle gets sucked down into the water chamber.</p></li>
<li><p>Pretty similar but instead of the ready brewed coffee it is some of the grounds that get sucked into the water chamber and keep brewing there in the rest of the water. It may be that it is ground too finely.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these things are not a problem though, just flush everything with warm water and that's it (no detergent if it's an aluminium pot or you risk oxidation).  It only affects the coffee if you cut the heat way too early or too late.</p>

4304,2,,2018-08-02T15:17:36.290,3,,"<p>Yes you can adjust the calibration of grind size of the EK43.</p>

<p>Have the grinder plugged in and ready. Turn the adjustment knob all the way to the right. Losen the two screws on the sides of the knob slightly (turn the hexagon shaped screwdriver once). The screws are on the sides of the knob, fixing the big adjustment screw in the middle of the knob. Once they are losend you can use a flat head screwdriver or a coin to turn the screw in the middle of the know. Keep the knob totally turned to the right, to the smallest grind size setting.</p>

<p>So now normally you would turn it slowly to the right while your grinder is turned on until you hear a slight rattling sound. This sound occurs when the burrs are touching. Once you hear the sound, immediately turn the screw back by about ten degrees until the sound stops and the burrs aren't touching anymore. That is the standard calibration and the only one viable for espresso.</p>

<p>In your case you want to turn the screw further counter clockwise, so the burrs are further apart until you get the desired grind size. The maximum grind size will be coarser as well as the minimum. That also means that the grinder will not grind fine enough for espresso anymore.</p>

<p>I don't know if this is recommendable to do, I don't think anything can break. But I will also not guarantee it. To be sure write a mail to Mahlkönig. Also I think there are instructions in the grinder manual on how to calibrate it (to the standard espresso setting).</p>

<p>During this depressurization, nitrogen losses lots of energy, thus the temperature around it decreases*. Probably, the most thermally conductive thing around is the can itself as it is made out of metal**. So, the water vapor in the air condensed on the metal itself***, which remains a wet spot.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key to interpret the several factors affecting the crema,
  seems to be the carbon dioxide content of roasted coffee in
  addition to CO2 possibly present as bicarbonate ions in the
  water ingredient. Most of the data reported in the present
  review may suggest that espresso brewing can be described
  as “a quick way to transfer carbon dioxide from roasted and
  ground coffee to a small cup by means of hot water under
  pressure”. This then leads to the facts that for espresso
  coffee, carbon dioxide has to be:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>generated by roasting</li>
  <li>maintained in the bean by proper packaging</li>
  <li>maintained in the ground coffee</li>
  <li>solubilized in water</li>
  <li>released into the beverage.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>In this framework statements such as “any error in
  grinding or in percolation, in temperature or extraction
  level, has an immediate effect on denounced by the color,
  the texture and the persistence of the foam” or “the foam is
  the signature of a well-prepared espresso” can be well
  justified. In fact, foam volume, persistence, and consistence
  are the consequences of the carbon dioxide content
  originally present in the coffee. In addition to the
  importance of carbon dioxide in espresso coffee foam, we
  believe that carbon dioxide can play a role even from a taste
  point of view. This aspect has not yet been the subject of
  investigation.</p>

Your core temperature increases because of central nervous system activation and your body tries to regulate temperature. However 5 cups a day don't seem close to an overdose unless your caffeine tolerance is very low and studies have shown that normal dosages of caffeine intake don't alter core temperature or increase sweating to an extent where it would affect your hydration (see e.g. McLellan et. al 2016 for a Review). It still might be noticeable if you sweat a lot in general. I would just trial and error it by not drinking coffee for a few days. You might notice increased sweating for a day or two from withdrawal but that should pass after a couple of days.

<p>To do so, you need lots of metal to evenly share and distribute the thermal capacity. But... Turkish coffee brewing must be done so quickly. Somewhere around 80 seconds at all. Then, you also need thermal connectivity; which boils down to thick copper.</p>

<p>Again, copper may be poisonous; so, it is plated. Better option is silver for better thermal connectivity. Second, cheaper option is tin. As you see, even a single cezve may cost a lot.</p>

Even coffee shops in Aceh are never empty of visitors, presenting various forms of coffee creation for the audience. For the people of Aceh, drinking coffee is not only daily traditions. Drinking coffee can also increase stamina, or the people of Aceh often call it poding. The true coding is coffee mixed with eggs. Coffee and eggs are dishes that come from a mixture of coffee after filtering the pulp and mixing the eggs.
Although it has been mixed with eggs, the aroma of the coffee still feels, and does not smell fishy. To get rid of fishy odors, the eggs that have been shaken use a mixer and then soaked in hot water. Then given a mixture of coffee and a little sweetened condensed milk</p>

<p>The reason to have a thin pellet (cake) when you fill your double basket with a single shot amount of grounds is, the area of the double basket is set to hold twice as much grounds of a single shot basket.</p>

<p>The reason behind that is the Darcy equation which defines the filtering properties based on</p>

<ul>
<li>area <em>(constant in both baskets)</em>,</li>
<li>viscosity <em>(constant for water)</em>,</li>
<li>filtration velocity <em>(constant, if we assume you have constant pressure)</em>,</li>
<li>filtration permeability <em>(we'll come to that later)</em>,</li>
<li>and the thickness of the pellet <em>(we'll come to that later)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, non-constants in this equation are the thickness of your pellet and the filtration permeability. Let's consider permeability first. Kozeny&amp;Carman equation defines this for porous medium. I can say, in short, reliable grind size defines this. Therefore, if you are ensured that you have homogeneously ground coffee and tamp them with equal force (say 15 kg-f), you can safely assume permeability as constant, too.</p>

<p>Now, the last one: thickness of the pellet. Please see the below photograph I have taken, first.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gro7r.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gro7r.jpg"" alt=""single and double spout portafilters""></a></p>

<p>As you see, the single spout portafilter has less space and the water flows from a narrower set of holes to keep the thickness constant. When you fill the double spout portafilter, the water flows uniformly and the thickness will still be the same.</p>

<p>So, all you need to do is setting your grinder to single shot amount (7-9 grams). Then, using single or double portafilter according to your needs. When you need a single shot, fill your portafilter with a single shot amount of coffee. Filling your double portafilter with double the amount ends up a doppio or two espressos in two cups.</p>

<p>So my question is which of the following two scenarios provide a better cup of coffee:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grinding from very good beans each time using the Wilfa Grinder, knowing that there will always be some old coffee residue on the blades.</li>
<li>Buying 250g of the same very good coffee, but having it ground before delivery?</li>

Lots of people are happy with in-store grinding, or with grinding beans at night and letting them sit in a timed coffee maker until the morning.

4368,2,,2018-09-04T16:42:02.317,2,,"<p>Coffee producers tailor their production to worldwide demand for coffee.  Wet processing of coffee produces large quantities of green coffee bean for the lowest production cost.  The process is more automated and satisfies the world's demand for low cost coffee.  Dry processed (what you are calling ""natural"") coffee is the oldest processing method since it doesn't require large volumes of water, and compared to wet processing, is time consuming and labor intensive.  The resulting beans therefore tend to be more expensive.  Unfortunately it seems that people value low cost over quality coffee, at least on a mass consumer scale.</p>

<p>I drink exclusively dry processed Ethiopian coffees, mostly Yirgacheffe or something from nearby.  They are indeed slightly more expensive but since I roast my own beans, the cost is still quite low compared to buying roasted beans at full retail price.  You are correct in noticing the relatively scarce offerings of DP coffees, but I source my beans from several different online sellers, and am usually able to find at least one with a current Ethiopian DP coffee.</p>

<p>I would encourage you to also search for ""dry process"" or ""DP"" coffee, in addition to ""natural"" since there really isn't very good standardization of terms across the industry.  I should say that I began roasting my own beans only after I found how much I liked dry processed coffee and how hard it was to find, so I completely understand your frustration.  The upside to roasting my own was that it's guaranteed to be fresh, a critical part of really good coffee. Good luck!</p>

<p>No one really knows for sure. Some naval vessels used to put salt in the coffee either to kill the bitterness (or to help stay hydrated), but it was neither a universal or permanent practice.</p>

<p><strong>William Ewing, QM1(SW) USN (ret), Quartermaster E-6</strong> has this to about the subject:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When navy coffee was 50% chicory, 50% cheap coffee (most of my career), it was a dying practice, based on previous coffee that was very bitter. Nowadays, the 50% chicory formula is not bitter enough to require that, and many ships get Starbucks, which they then mix with the chicory coffee to smooth the taste even more.</p>
  
  <p>Now, for a while, Denny's had some bad coffee, and for over a year, my friends and I added salt to kill the bitterness and extra sugar to overpower the salt. Then Denny's switched blends to one not as awful, so we could drink it without salt. - <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Do-Navy-people-put-salt-into-their-coffee"" rel=""noreferrer"">Do Navy people put salt into their coffee?</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other sources say the complete opposite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had to make many, many pots of coffee as a mess crank (one who spends their first 90 days or so working on the mess decks. Think of it as KP for 90 days straight).</p>
  
  <p>We used a large commercial drip coffeepot and coffee, period. No salt was added, at least I never added any. That it is strong comes from the fact that the Navy has no contracts with suppliers that have decent coffee.</p>
  
  <p>It is possible that the salty taste does come from the fact that shipboard water is naturally salty. When a ship is in port, she's hooked up to local water. IIRC, ships at sea have a special desalinization process that isn't perfect, but it comes fairly close. - <a href=""https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-91446.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">How the Real Men in the Navy Make Their Coffee</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a number of years, I used to put salt in the grounds to help remove the bitterness of the coffee. Please not that this was <strong>not</strong> navy coffee and I was making a 100 cups at a time. No one ever complained, but that might have been to sure dumb luck too.</p>

<p>The Urban Possum has this to say about <a href=""http://theurbanpossum.blogspot.com/2004/11/navy-coffee.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Navy Coffee</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Use an economy-brand coffee. Mother Parker's, for example, or Chase &amp; Sanborn. If you have to talk in terms of roasts, these brands are a light to medium--perfectly acceptable to a majority of people. Their virtue is that they're cheap--hey, it's Navy coffee. We're talking government suppliers here.  </p></li>
  <li><p>Use 2 level tablespoons for each 8-ounce cup. The standard measure for coffee is 1 level tablespoon for a 6-ounce cup. The power of Navy Coffee does not derive from the strength of the roast, but from the amount of coffee used, so as you can see, this one is stronger than most. Some old chiefs like the coffee so strong that it actually seems chewy (that comes from the tannins in the coffee and their effects on the tooth surface), but we don't need to go quite that far. </p></li>
  <li><p>Salt the grounds before you begin brewing. Salt, as in ordinary table salt. The measurement is a pinch, which is about 1/8th to a maximum of 1/4 teaspoon per 5 cups brewed. This is the secret to True Navy coffee: the salt will cut the initial bitterness of the coffee, but takes nothing away from the aroma. Don't worry too much about the taste, Navy coffee won't taste salty unless you use too much of it. </p></li>
  </ol>

4389,1,,2018-09-11T03:18:49.947,1,678,"<p>I'm a longtime French press user but I've been grinding my beans finely for a few years. Espresso-fine I guess. Ground to a powder really. I much prefer the richer, more buttery, oily cup to the thinner and lighter cup you get from the prescribed coarse grind. Yes, there's always some grit at the bottom of my cup, but I'm totally fine to toss the last ounce or two of my mug for what ends up being a delicious cup of coffee.</p>

<p>I'm wondering two things:
- if there's an additional filter or tweak I could make to my setup to minimize the grit and save those last could ounces
- or if what I'm doing, brewing finely ground coffee in a French press, is sacrilege and I should really find a more appropriate brewing method such as a moka or whatever else. Again, I much prefer the consistency and oily feel of unfiltered coffee to any pourover I've ever had.</p>

<p>There are a couple options here, the first being modifying your french press a bit and the second being a different brewer that may be easier for attaining your goal. </p>

<p>As B540Glenn mentioned, you can try cutting our a paper filter into a circle and putting it next to the mesh filter in your french press. This will get rid of a lot of the grittiness and a little bit of the oiliness but will keep your big body.</p>

<p>The second option is to try out a Clever Dripper. It combines what you seem to like about immersion brewing and combines it with a paper filter that drains into your mug when you're ready. It's a simpler and faster way of achieving what probably is a similar result to the french press with paper filter method.</p>

4394,2,,2018-09-17T20:03:47.830,1,,"<p>I've been drinking it at home for a while now. I really love it. It tastes very different from roasted coffee, so don't try to compare it.
I think much like one wouldn't compare yogurt and whipped cream.
And later in the stomach it feels much better than roasted coffee.</p>

<p>The amount of caffeine is about the same, for the same amount of original beans (their volume and weight changes during roasting, so don't compare by weight).</p>

<p>For preparing I think the main difference in the brew is that it needs a longer cook than roasted beans, because the green are harder (or tougher), it takes more time to soak out their juice. So for example you can't do a quick extraction like in espresso machine.
Another thing, you should not use cold brew - you shouldn't drink coffee absolutely raw - it must be heated at least once. So roasted coffee is already cooked, and you can do cold brew, but green coffee must be cooked before it's drunk. I'm not sure how bad raw coffee would be to your health wise, I heard somewhere on the web that it's bad, I dunno, it tastes like shit, and I wouldn't try it myself.</p>

<p>Preferably grind beans first (buy them ground, they're really hard to grind), because it extracts more efficiently.</p>

<p>Basically just cook the grounds/beans in water, and then drink the water.</p>

<ul>
<li>i cook for 60 minutes in a pot on lower than boiling temperature, the closer you get to boil temperature it gives a somewhat different taste, but it's all great I think, just try. You can cook for 10-15 minutes too, but I think you'd extract less from the same amount of beans. Mixing the water will extract faster. Keep it closed so it doesn't get too much air during long cook, the less it oxygenizes the fresher is tastes I think. A well-covered pot with just a small whole for water vapor is good. </li>
<li>Otherwise when I can't stay home to cook it, I just put the ground coffee in a thermos and fill it up with water about 80-90'celsius and seal it, so the heat is preserved, and it gets ""cooked"" for a couple of hours and then I drink it. Usually I shake it every few minutes to get it to extract better.</li>
<li>I think it stays very fresh for a few hours in a sealed thermos (don't let it touch air too much).</li>
</ul>

<p>On the web some people suggest to soak the beans for 12 hours before cooking.
It’s more complicated to do I think. Depending on the original processing these beans had (wet or dry process), they might get too fermented. I only tried it once, and it was too fermented for my taste.
But if you have the time, I’d recommend trying it, my guess if done well it could be very nice, like sprouted legumes.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Keepers_Friend"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia's article on Bar Keeper's Friend</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike more abrasive cleaning powders such as Comet and Ajax, Bar Keepers Friend uses oxalic acid as its primary active ingredient. A similar abrasive cleaning product, Zud Heavy Duty Cleanser, also contains oxalic acid. Prolonged use and extended skin contact may cause irritation, peeling and contact dermatitis, which is avoided by wearing gloves. The product can also be an eye irritant.</p>

<p>For your specific pot I would get a good scrub brush and some BKF and give it a few minutes scrub and it will look new again!  I think BKF may be one of the most underrated tools for us coffee junkies.  It gets everything so clean, it even has taken those impossible stains out of the bottom of some of my well used coffee cups.  </p>

4407,2,,2018-09-25T14:00:26.307,2,,"<p>The short answer is pretty obvious. Any coffee, as long as it's not decaffeinated, keeps you awake. While that is true, it is also true that some coffees have more caffein than others, some preparation methods contain more caffein than others and the ability of any coffee to keep you awake has obviously also limitations. If you are close to passing out from fatigue, than coffee also won't help that much anymore. I'm gonna break it all down quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee type</strong></p>

<p>There are two commercially important types of coffee beans. Arabica and Robusta. Arabica plants produce higher quality coffee with better and more complex flavors. However in terms of caffein content Robusta coffee is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#cite_note-Bunker-160"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">much higher</a> with roughly twice the caffein in the brewed cup.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee preparation</strong></p>

<p>Generally speaking you could divide coffee preparation into two different groups. Espresso and everything else. Everything else has many sub groups that I'm not gonna get into too much now. The common understanding is that espresso is ""stronger"" with which is meant that it has more caffein than other coffee drinks. That is true when you measure per ml. However due to the small servings of espresso the <a href=""http://www.coffeescience.org/caffeine-coffee/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">caffein content</a> of one shot of espresso is lower than that of a typical cup of filter coffee. An espresso shot contains roughly 53mg of caffein while a cup of drip coffee has more than twice to three times as much (115mg to 175mg) due to the bigger serving size. Turkish coffee has even higher contents.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>

<p>So based on this information I would recommend you to slowly drink several cups of brewed or filtered Arabica coffee during your night shifts. That should keep you caffeinated and awake more effectively than espresso plus you get to drink delicious coffee all night long. The maximum caffein content you would get with a turkish style preparation, in my opinion the best trade off between caffein and flavor would be drip coffee though. It's lighter in taste so you can drink more as well. I would recommend Arabica for the better taste and possible health benefits as compared to Robusta. You don't have to be afraid of negative health effects. Coffee is largely redeemed and is today even considered a healthy beverage with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#Health_effects"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">possible positive effects</a> on cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, some forms of cancer, degenerative diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimers and many more.</p>

4410,2,,2018-09-26T09:40:46.190,4,,"<p>Coffee is an excellent countermeasure against drowsiness in general. The main and best understood mechanism of action of caffeine is that it blocks the receptors of adenosine in your brain. Adenosine is responsible for the feeling of drowsiness. It accumulates throughout the day and would act to make you feel increasingly tired. In addition caffeine likely has effects on your dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline levels. They are all chemicals  considered to be excitatory neurotransmitters. Nehlig et al. (1992) made an extensive review of the action mechanisms of caffeine. A more recent review was published by MacLellan et al. (2016).</p>

<p>Drowsiness from oversleeping occasionally probably stems from a disruption of your cycadian rhythm. If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle before completing it, you will feel groggy and tired. Caffeine will certainly have some effect through the stimulation of your central nervous system and the increased release of stimulating neurotransmitters. But so would a morning work out or a walk in the sun. Which one is more effective for you, you will have to trial and error. I'd combine them I guess. </p>

<p>Chronic oversleeping however should be considered a medical issue. Hypersomnia could be a symptom for many other, more serious issues ranging from sleep apnea to depression and other neurological diseases. In these cases caffeine might have positive or negative effects. But that is a question you should ask to your physicians.</p>

<p>I work from home and often don't have the time to go to a coffee shop to get a nice freshly brewed coffee.</p>

<h2>Solutions I've Tried</h2>

<p>To combat this, I've tried various solutions such as a French Press and organic instant.</p>

<p>The organic brand of instant coffee I found is a little better than other brands, but it's still almost unbearably bad unless I lace it with lots of milk and sugar, as per this question <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3020/why-instant-coffee-has-poor-reputation/3024#3024"">here</a>. However, I try to avoid sugar, especially in coffee.</p>

<p>Although the French Press tastes a little better than instant, it's a pain to use, clean and prepare, and is a little too time-consuming.</p>

<h2>Expensive Consumer Grade Coffee Machines</h2>

<p>I was thinking about getting a coffee machine but found them to be incredibly expensive with no guarantee it will last or taste any better than a French Press. And with so many variations, it's hard to know which to choose. I don't trust reviews as they are often sponsored or left by the manufacturer themselves, so it's hard to know if they are actually any good.</p>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<li>Apologies if this is a duplicate. I did look but didn't see a similar question with an answer. I will delete this question if there is one.</li>
<li>I understand that a good coffee requires good barista skills. This question is about what equipment can help me achieve that quickly from home without breaking the bank.</li>

This may require you to take down a few parts (don't worry, they are designed for this) and assamble afterwards. Then, of course clean and decalcify as in regular espresso machines. This option may require a bit more care, but at the end, it is way faster in daily use.</p></li>

4422,2,,2018-10-02T13:14:05.720,2,,"<p>There are a few options you have here and 500€ is a good budget. You want good coffee throughout the day with the least amount of work possible. Also I assume you are looking for large cups of coffee since you tried instant and french press. So you should forget about espresso machines and forget about anything handmade. You need something automated for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Option A: Espresso machine</strong></p>

<p>If you want coffee drinks with milk in it the way to go is to get an espresso machine. However I think for you it's not a good solution for the following reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>It's quite complex to get into and to be able to make good coffee. It doesn't go well with your time requirement.</li>
<li>It is much more costly than the other options. Grinders for espresso start around 250€. It is in my opinion the minimum you should invest for good results, although more would be better. Decent espresso machines for home use start at 500€. It's also the minimum I would recommend you to invest. That's already way over budget. A decent alternative would be to get an electric burr grinder, a good stove top coffee maker and a milk steamer.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Option B: fully automated bean-to-cup machine</strong></p>

<p>In my experience the coffee these machines make are pretty awful. Convenience is their strength though. A fully automated machine that makes milk based drinks automatically will set you back as much as the espresso machine/grinder setup. Though at a much lower drink quality. Jura is a famous brand for these machines. I think they may be a good solution for larger offices where everyone has different preferences as you can make black coffee as well as milk based drinks. I think you specifically have to consider the trade off between price, quality and convenience. If convenience is your main consideration you might be happy with one of those.</p>

<p><strong>Option C: Capsule machine</strong></p>

<p>A typical consumer grade, capsule or pad/pod based coffee machine is as simple as it gets. The time you need to prepare a cup of coffee is probably shorter than with any other system at the price they are charging you for the machines (you can get them for 100€ easy). However there are some downsides that disqualify these machines in my opinion.</p>

<ol>
<li>The price per coffee is way too high.</li>
<li>They produce an insane amount of trash (this can be avoided with refillable capsules at cost of convenience).</li>
<li>The quality of the coffee is pretty low.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would argue this doesn't fit your criteria since you won't get high quality coffee (plus the other downsides). I would probably prefer it to a fully automated machine though and invest some of the saved money in a decent milk steamer if you want to make milk based drinks. It's slightly more work but much cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Option D: Filter coffee machine</strong></p>

<p>I believe this is the way to go for you. It's within your budget, fits your criteria of low maintenance and good quality and it supplies you with coffee for the entire day. Get an electric home grinder and a good filter coffee machine. For 150€ you can buy a very good electric home grinder (check Baratza) and for 200-250€ an amazing filter coffee machine (Check the SCAA approved home drip machines, I recommend Moccamaster). Handling it is extremely easy. Fill the tank with mineral water, grind the coffee (weigh it for optimal results), put it in the filter basket with the paper filter inside, turn on the machine and wait for 2min. There are many advantages over any other system when it comes to your criteria.</p>

<ol>
<li>Preparation time is low. Preparing a whole pot of coffee will only take you a couple of minutes of which you only actually work for maybe 30s.</li>
<li>Cleaning is extremely simple. Throw the paper filter with coffee grounds and flush the basket. Occasionally put the basket in the dish washer. Same for thermos. Flush with warm water and occasionally clean with soap.</li>
<li>Preparation is extremely simple. You basically can't mess it up as long as you follow a recipe (coffee-water ratio) that the roaster can recommend you or that you find on the internet, because all the variables are preset by the machine.</li>
<li>If you get a good filter coffee machine with a good thermos you will have warm coffee for half a day. So say you make one pot in the morning for breakfast. That will last you until midday. Prepare another one after lunch which will last you until the evening when you finish work.</li>
<li>The coffee (provided that you buy good beans) will be far better than with any other automated solution.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>With your budget and your requirements I think getting good milk based drinks is difficult. Quality will always suffer greatly. If you insist on it though, I think you should buy an electric grinder, a good stove top coffee maker and a milk steamer as suggested in Option A. A bit more time consuming but better coffee as the other options (except the espresso machine). </p>

<p>Hands down though a filter coffee machine is the way to go if you are willing to adjust yourself to black coffee. It's healthier anyways and I believe anyone who is willing to try drip coffee will come to realize that it's the far superior way to consume this wonderful beverage.</p>

However, if you're experiencing side effects - such as: a migraine headache, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, restlessness, frequent urination or inability to control urination, stomach upset, fast heartbeat, muscle tremors) - to consider cutting back the amount of coffee you intake. This is true not just for those that have more than 4 cups of coffee a day, but for all who drink coffee. Some people are more susceptible to coffee's effects than others, so if you feel woozy or unsteady even after two, maybe it's a good idea to cut back. If coffee is affecting your sleep schedule, also cut back. If you use it to wake up in the morning or rely on it, perhaps going to bed sooner is a better option as sleep deprivation is one of the largest catalysts in becoming an unhealthy adult.

<p>The cezve presented here is an electrical Turkish coffee pot with proper quality.</p>

<p>Decoction brewing technique (mixing grounds and water together, then heat them up) and their alternatives are the only ones you can do. Worse, you cannot slow down heating in an electrical pot. Actually, quick heating is something desired for good Turkish coffee. But, you cannot use this for <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3074/what-is-m%C4%B1rra-the-over-brewed-turkish-coffee"">mırra</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Adding flavors may be an option. Like cardamom, mastic, etc. to diversify the Turkish coffee.</p>

<p>Another option which is rarely made in Turkey is adding milk after preparing the coffee. First, you need to wait a while for the grounds settle down. Then, pour the non-grounded part on another cup and add warm milk. It resembles <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/217/how-do-i-use-this-indian-coffee-maker"">Indian coffee</a>, but without sugar. And you cannot use their fancy filtering equipment. This may resemble latte a bit. But, I can't think of any other options.</p>

<p>One side note... Such an electrical pot is a cool device to quickly heat up water. So, if you also place a few more cups and grab some filters you can filter your own coffee. When I was a student, I used to use this a lot. I used a similar machine to prepare Turkish coffee at the same time I directly filter my grounds with a Melitta filter on my cup.</p>

<p>To help preventing your beans/grounds from going stale quickly, store them in the freezer in an airtight container.  This mainly helps with preventing the oils from going rancid/off and helps prevent any unwanted flavours. This works better for beans as they will remain colder for longer and prevent the oils from turning and remaining flavourful. </p>

<p>This will allow you to make better coffee using french press or moka pot. However, that being said, if you only buy 2-3 coffees a week, its probably better to find a really nice cafe where they know what they are doing and make a moment out of your coffee. It is most likely that a good cafe will easily surpass whatever coffee you can make at home (especially if you are only making 2-3 a week), and then it becomes easily worth the extra couple of bucks. </p>

<p>To prevent a caffeine overdose, avoid consuming excessive amounts of
caffeine. In most cases, you shouldn’t have more than 400 mg of

<p>The short answer to your last two questions is that one can be addicted to or dependent on caffeine.

4487,2,,2018-11-07T10:19:46.993,0,,"<p>I don't know the exact answer of your question. However, I can say that whichever bean has more sugars, it should produce more crema.</p>

<p>I deduce this such that, crema is composed of three things: some irregularities in coffee (e.g. microscopic ground particles) to trigger bubble production, CO<sub>2</sub> to fill into the bubble, and finally some oil that's extracted from the grounds during brewing to jail the CO<sub>2</sub> inside.</p>

<ul>
<li>Irregularities are common. So, this should not be the limiting case.</li>
<li>Oils... I assume most quality beans have enough of that and a proper brewing extracts them.</li>
<li>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> is relevant to the Maillard reaction during roasting. As some of the organic compounds (hydrocarbons) in the bean, mostly sugars, crack down to smaller hydrocarbons and release it. The released CO<sub>2</sub> is trapped within the beans' texture till you brew it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, I assume, the initial amount of hydrocarbons and correct roasting is the key factor. Note that, if you leave beans for long, the trapped CO<sub>2</sub> will eventually be released so you cannot have proper crema with stale beans.</p>

<p>And about the brewing method. The crema production is, for sure, affected by the brewing method. Espresso always has more homogeneous crema as it is made by a proper machine and Turkish crema should be marbled that reflects the several phases of brewing. But, the basic bubble formation is always the same.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Let's wait for another answer that may compare the crema characteristics of Arabica and Robusta.</p>

<p>Caffeine molecules increase and stay at high levels if a person is a regular drinker. During this phase, your body reacts that and adapts to handle more caffeine.</p>

<p>It's like diving deep and staying there for some time. Then, if you rapidly swim up to the surface you caught caisson disease.</p>

<p>Human body is very resilient to changing caffeine levels. It can adapt easily. But, it cannot adapt so fast. If someone is afraid of being addicted, they can slowly decrease the amount of coffee they consume per day.</p>

<p>For example, think of someone drinks 6 cups a day. If decrease rate is a cup per three days, after 15 days daily consumption will be a cup per day. Seems reasonable with no headaches.</p>

<p>The Magnifica costs about $525 US, which is about as expensive as the Breville.  However, when you do the math, it is not that bad, except that it requires a larger up front investment. Plus, you do not need to buy a grinder.</p>

<p>I compared to a Keurig machine which will cost around $100 US, and uses pods that cost between $0.50 or $0.90 per cup. My favorite coffee beans sell for about $12 for 2 lbs (thank you, Costco), which translates to about $0.10 per cup in the Magnifica.</p>

<p>I computed that the Magnifica initial and operating cost will break even with the Keurig cost in much less than a year.  No pod waste either. No coffee grounds all over my counters due to static electricity from a separate grinder.</p>

<p>So far, I love the machine. I get great crema and a lovely cup at the push of a button.</p>

<p>The machine has a dual block system to ensure that the manual steam wand is ready to go.  However, I do not know enough to tell you if the frothier produces appropriate microfoam for latte art.  It makes good cappuccino and latte, as far as I am concerned, but I am not an artist about it. </p>

Despite all the opinion otherwise, I don’t think microwave reheating ruins the coffee at all. Of course, the taste does not improve with age, but less heat overall, and reheating is so much better than leaving the coffee on a heat source.

Roasted coffee beans can be stored for up to 12 months in heat-sealable film or foil-based packages. Such packages have a special gas discharge valve. It is required for freshly roasted coffee beans, after roasting, they continue to release carbon dioxide, thanks to the discovery of the smallest internal capsules. If you let the beans completely exhale, then they will be subjected to strong oxidation.Fried grains in opaque jars with hermetically lapped lids, Packed in a factory way, also have a long shelf life-up to 18 months.</p>

<p>First is temperature of the water. The machine takes care of that for me. Check.</p>

<p>The next is how long it takes for the water to run through the grounded beans. This should be around 25 seconds. Your personal taste may make it a bit higher or lower.</p>

<p>Now I've got the grinding of the beans, and how coarse or fine that should be. Does this affect the taste directly, or is that just one parameter combined with how hard the beans are pressed, that goes into how long the water takes to run through? Or does this by itself have a more direct effect on the taste?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what method the machine uses to detect water levels, nothing in the owner's manual or cleaning/maintenance manual seems to cover this problem.</p>

<p>There does appear to be a small hole where it does seem that there's a glass recessed where I'm thinking there might be an ""electric eye"" but I can see no other visible way for it to detect water level.  I realize that's not likely it because the graphic display will show actual level, not just empty.</p>

<p>The manual does refer to a ""float"" device, but it doesn't document it very well, and it looks like it might be difficult to get to, requiring disassembly of the machine.</p>

<p>I have to admit (embarrassingly) that I've never cleaned the machine in the years we've all used it.  Should that be my first step?  equal parts white vinegar and water?  Or is that likely to have no effect on my water level detection problem?</p>

<p>What you can do? You may try to trick the sensor with a magnet. I cannot think that it is practical if you cannot really build a working mechanism for daily use.</p>

I fill the roaster with the appropriate amount of beans (weighed out if possible). I roast on low until the beans are getting lighter green and starting to swell a little (usually 1-2 minutes). During the roast I always tilt the roaster to let the beans on the side be mixed into the middle. I do this every 6-10 seconds and wear insulated gloves that you can hold onto it well. I slipped once and besides spilling the beans it broke my roasting chamber. I switch to medium until they are the color of desert camo (tan with some darker browns), That doesn't take much more than a minute. Switch to high and adjust fan as necessary to keep beans moving. Keeping it as low as possible will allow heat to build more quickly. First crack will start when the timer is down to 4 or 5 minutes left. You can reduce fan speed further to build heat more quickly and can increase it during tilts to aid in agitating the beans. If you don't hear second crack by near the end of the time it may be necessary to increase it 1 or 2 minutes.

<p>The used pods do not lose an mass / material, in the way that many k-cups do.  There are many k-cups types that, after using, weight much less because the hot water has dissolved the contents (sugar and hydrogenated oils) and delivered them to your cup.</p>

<p>Let's think about the mechanism of a grinder. Why grinders may get damaged if you adjust them when the burrs are not rotating?</p>

<p>A perfect coffee grinder design is a very serious engineering problem.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need to have two very rigid burrs. When you don't have this rigidity, burrs may be damaged under high pressure of stuck coffee beans. Also, you don't want them to change their ideal shape in time.</p></li>
<li><p>You want the burrs to rotate in opposite directions when they are so close to each other. The distance of the burrs must be equal at every rotational position to produce consistent ground. In practice, every grinder is a bit skewed from the ideal position. So, burrs are closer to each other at one angular position and more apart at another position.</p></li>
<li><p>You want a heat conducting material to keep the beans from burning after all the friction in between the burrs. Also, you don't want the heat deposit on the burrs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The caution you've noticed is mostly relevant to the second bullet. If, by mistake, you squeeze the burrs so close to each other they may damage each other in the next run. So, they can grind each other. While the grinder is running, even if you want to, you cannot squeeze till they touch. Even if you do, you suddenly hear a loud noise to release the setting a bit. However, if the grinder stops at an (somewhat) apart position and you squeeze them to touch, you cannot notice that.</p>

<p>If it grinds consistently, probably it is OK. But do not gamble again.</p>

4572,2,,2018-12-22T23:12:28.933,3,,"<p>As they are two different methods of brewing, it is normal that they taste different.</p>

<p>One very clear difference is the temperature of the water. Moka pots practically use water/steam. This let's the extraction happen in a warmer environment than recommended. Additional bitter notes of the bean is also extracted. More importantly, you loose some aromatics as they evaporate quickly. However, as you don't use a fine filter, you and up with a more bodily cup.</p>

<p>V60 effectively filters out the body of the bean. Also, you brew in the recommended degree (around 95 degree Celcius). The result is a more finer, light, herbal-tea-like cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Note: I realized that you did not mention your grind size. Grounds must be grinded in different sizes for both methods. If you use the same size, it is also another reason for the difference in the taste.

<p><strong>1. An electric stove is fine.</strong><br>
If you are starting with boiling water, go medium-to-low, reduce heat to a minimum once the coffee starts to rise/appear - or even turn it off, see 2. below. If you are starting with cold water (I can't be fiddling with a hot metal vessel after a short night and without sufficient caffeine in my system - see <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/31514995#31514995"">here</a> and <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/34688024#34688024"">here</a>),initially go full-speed to minimize the not-so-hot water trickling through phase, then proceed as described above.</p>

<p><strong>2. Violent frothing may be a sign of different things.</strong><br>
My first suspicion would be you missing the sweet spot of turning the heat down in time - or too much residual heat in your stove top. Note that electric plates are <em>a lot</em> slower to react that gas, where you can instantly cut the heat. Learn to ""play"" your specific stove, and as an emergency measure, simply lift the Brikka off the stove.<br>
A second issue could be the grind. While a Moka needs a finer grind than drip, a true espresso grind is too fine (and a common beginner's mistake when making ""stovetop espresso""). In the best case, a too-fine grind will just be over-extracted and give you a lot of dregs in the cup. But the fine grid will also compact more, so that your machine will be working at a higher-than intended pressure. It may be enough to trigger the valve, but it may also be ever so slightly below the critical value, still giving you a rather forceful ""volcanic action"" (as I observed in the context of <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3356/coffee-ground-too-finely-how-to-deal-with-it"">this question)</a>. </p>

You can make medium strength coffee in it as well. I have pleased family members who do not like strong coffee using my percolator. It is all in the heat and the proper timing.

  <p>I suppose I would consider optimal caffeine (primarily through coffee)
  usage to any usage that maximizes fatigue
  reduction/alertness/wakefulness whilst minimizing tolerance build-up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok Rumps, given that interest, let me offer a few notes-</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Adaptation: first off, our brains adapt to caffeine over time, so a dose that may give you effects now, may give you zero effects later. </p></li>
<li><p>Plan to back off from caffeine every month or so if your goal is this effect rather than just the pleasure of the beverage. Why? Some receptor clean up in the brain needs to happen and that takes time.</p></li>
<li><p>Caffeine does not reduce fatigue - just to be clear - fatigue is a set of system level responses that tell you you are potentially under slept or under nourished  - using a drug to mask that doesn't sort that problem. What caffeine can do is?</p></li>
<li><p>Caffeine assists ""alertness"" by again blocking what the body is telling you about rest - So, it's a kind of chicken and egg thing in terms of how it works: Caffeine will block adenosine receptors in the brain especially later in the day (when this substance builds up in the brain to start a wind down cycle) - and that's for many people about the worst time to have a coffee - because of its half life it can really start to disrupt sleep - and make it harder to get to sleep. </p></li>
<li><p>Caffeine also seems to be associated with helping folks work out hard, and also perform better on cognitive tests - when used as a dose in an experiment right before a test. So that may say something about ""strategic dosing"" for an acute effect (effect right at time of need), and having to work hard physically can be boosted here by the connection to serotonin - and other cool stuff happening in muscles.</p></li>
<li><p>And yes caffeine is a long time supporter of fat burning too - so it seems to rev up fat burning - but so does green tea. </p></li>
<li><p>As much as I'm skeptical about some of this - the weight of evidence suggests that moderate coffee drinking has no ill effects, and while some of the benefits may be attenuated as one adapts, it's not causing harm. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>A nice overview from 2010 is <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900710002510?via%3Dihub"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<p>I haven't checked into more current research on each of these topics, but one review suggests that coffee compounds, when sent to a Petri dish of cancer cells, arrests proliferation of the cells - this seems like an awesome thing.
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6321559/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">See</a></p>

<p>In working with athletes and university students - to get a performance boost, however - they cycled their dosing - really tapering off before a key event, and using it strategically in a period before the event to get the benefits.</p>

<p>So, as to your question about optimal dosing - you can test a few things for yourself. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find out what your optimal cut off time is for coffee not to disturb you getting to sleep. Earlier is probably better: </p>

<ul>
<li>Most work suggests 6-8 hours before hitting the sack for sleep is needed to have caffeine flushed out of the system. </li>
<li>Also, coffee ups stomach acids - not a good idea before going to sleep 
and finally - If you don't need to push yourself awake don't do it. Figure out ways to get more rest - a challenge but after awhile if we rely on coffee to keep us upright, other things will break. So, try for a week to stop 8 hours before bed time - and after that week - play around. You might also wish to check out adding to that, reducing the amount of coffee you drink overall - but doesn't sound like a lot anyway.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Think about using coffee strategically - if you're doing something creative - see if having a coffee makes a difference; if you're doing a workout - see if coffee 20-30 mins before your heavy sets makes a difference - and if it does do you need it all the time - or maybe again strategically on particular sessions only.</p></li>
<li><p>Get into the pleasure of coffee as a beverage. 
Like building up a taste for dark, special really well made chocolate ups experience and reduces cravings (a little intense shot goes a long way), consider doing this with coffee. 
personal story: it's gotten to a point with me that I really prefer to roll my own: I pick the beans, grind them, make my coffee and enjoy it with intent - or with colleagues who share that experience. I no longer enjoy grabbing just any coffee. This means I have one or two cups a day (or sometimes none at all) because I enjoy the real thing so much I don't spend my caffeine/coffee nickle anywhere else. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So take-aways are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Test it for yourself - It's not only you in one moment but learning how different contexts affect this beverage.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider strategic dosing if that's what you're using it for
else.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe explore getting into coffee as a gorgeous food that you can give yourself as a daily ritual / treat. </p></li>
<li><p>Think about tapering off from time to time to re-up your sensitivity and enjoy even more - without being any food that's a drug too b**ch.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All the best
m.c.</p>

<p>PS - On effect on both workout intensity and on fat burning.</p>

<p>Because coffee is a food and has way more going on than caffeine, when I'm really focused on the caffeine properties around work outs (super hard training for an event) or fat burning (when already just a wee bit away from target body fat) I prefer to use caffeine pills as part of a ""stack"" for those effects - this may be way outside anything of interest, but it's just a focus/control thing.</p>

This is common practice when cupping new coffees so that bias does not affect our ideas of them. </p>

<p>Why would extraction time be longer or shorter if the grind size is the same, and we assume the same temperature of water and the same ratios. </p>

<p>That said - what perhasp Jean-Philippe Allard may be getting at is that there extraction time as a variable can change. IT may take three minutes for your pour over and longer or shorter for your urn</p>

<p>and extraction method does affect flavour. </p>

<p>also the actual drinking temp may be different - coffee really changes taste as it cools.</p>

<p>Also another factor is temperature - it may be easier to control water temp in one scenario over the other.  SO your 12 oz may be a pour over but what is the urn? shower over a basket? big press? </p>

<p>A different kind of comparison may be: same grind and different size of pour over - like a v60 01 vs a v60 02 using your grind/ratio - and of course your pour technique. </p>

4632,2,,2019-01-31T17:33:13.853,0,,"<p>Agree with what Stephie has written - </p>

<p>i'd add just a couple other things you may wish to explore - based on the linked post about gas with moka pots.</p>

<ul>
<li>There's kind of a debate in the moka pot community about whether to start with cold or hot water. I don't know why some folks like to start with really cold water. If you start with hotter (not boiling) water, you need less time to get the pot to get up to pressure. This is a good thing: less time means you're not heating up the beans overly long 
(some folks may say hey they've already been roasted - so what's a little more heat)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you use boiling water - in my experience the thing gets to pressure too fast and too hard and can't control it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>as for the frothing all over the place - that can be heat and speed creating that wild spew. But even on gentle temps grind size can have this effect - but not only going too fine: going a little larger can also have this effect for a similar reason - here the coffe will be taller in the funnel and get pressed down because dealing with slightly bigger particles - think about shutting the trunk of a care with a few big things verses the same number of smaller things. </p></li>
<li><p>as for taste - the spew is not necessarily going to cause an issue with taste - grind size is often more of the culprit there.<br>
one thing to check: how LONG does your brew take? A kind of good heuristic is: however long it takes your pot to get up to pushing out coffee - how long does it take to more or less finish?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>for a ""three cup"" - a smaller pot - generally speaking one minute to a minute ten seconds is in the zone. For me - no matter what kind of heating element (and i use induction mostly) - kill the heat at about 30secs - assuming its pushing out coffee. Pending how hard it's going either move it right off teh burner - or leave it on if it needs energy from the cooling element. </p>

<p>And then - just check flavour - </p>

<p>so you have a few things to test - one at a time:</p>

<ul>
<li>grind size for flavour  </li>
<li>time to fill </li>
<li>when to kill the heat to get the easiest non-spewing flow you can</li>
<li>grind size - find what size works best for your pot and see if that matches up with flavour</li>
</ul>

<p>One other wee tip: base cooling.
if it's done - before the output goes from coffee gold colours to white (blonding) you can test out putting the pot in a bowl with some water in the bottom - enough to cool the base to stop spitting out coffee. </p>

<p>awesome tools these things.

it's helpful when considering ""resaerch"" - to consider the source rather than the newspaper report of a resaerch paper. </p>

<p>More times than not - with coffee as with just about any other topic from science explained in the media - the news is taking a high level single take away from what may be a complex study. </p>

<p>For example: if something says ""coffee is bad"" what's under the headline? Bad for rats when forcefed caffeine for a week and kept awake?</p>

<p>Likewise for coffee, one of the best things to do if interested in the science is look for REVIEW articles, that have been carried out over the past couple years so the latest work is included - and see where the consensus is at - </p>

<p>That's one.</p>

<p>The other is to look at those reviews in terms of areas - so coffee consumption over X mg may be completely bad - for a particular effect - but completely fine in another. </p>

<p>Right now it's difficult to find where coffee at normal levels (a few cups a day) has any real problems. and may have benefits </p>

<p>For instance - this is a quote from a 2017 big review of studies on coffee</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5696634/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conclusion Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another review from 2017 - looking at impacts on health generally writes
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675917"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28675917</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3 - 4 cups/d providing 300 - 400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. This review provides up-to-date information about coffee on health. Topics addressed include the cardiovascular system, liver diseases, and diabetes as well as gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both cases, you can see the consensus, when looking at a variety of areas that are related to ""health"" suggest coffee is pretty ok.</p>

<p>Now if you want you can look into specific correlations like coffee and different types of cancer (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=coffee+cancer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=coffee+cancer</a>) - where intriguingly even here some work shows cancer cells in for instance collorectal cancer (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386640/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5386640/</a>) are inhibited by coffee - but that's if you get really intrigued with the topic.</p>

<p>Hope that helps empower your coffee journey</p>

<p>Main take away: if you see an ineresting news article making a claim about science - try to follow back to the original article being referenced and check out at least the abstract, and if you can the full article - in particular the conclusion.</p>

  <p>We use a 60/40 ratio of hot water to ice. For example, if you’re making a 500ml brew, your recipe will be 32.5g of coffee, 300g of hot water and 200g of ice. For best results, use filtered water with a low mineral content.</p>

<p>Ice goes in vessel; remaining hot water poured onto grounds as usual, and voila - stir coffee after to make sure ice is melted and - mmm mm good.</p>

<p>The post goes through WHY their ""low and slow"" approach to diffusion with a really coarse grind (really) and a longer 6-8min soak at a 1:14 - 1:16 ratio - but the effect - as they put it - is well worth trying.</p>

<p>It may all be me, but the only method i've found that i can get to work reliable from a single serving to multiple serving french press is this one. </p>

4646,2,,2019-02-04T12:40:56.550,1,,"<p>It's interesting how negative folks can get about freezing coffee.</p>

<p>There are a few places where freezing coffee has been tested to do really good things.</p>

<p>1) one good thing - is extending life (and flavour) of the roasted bean - when it's put down as soon after roasting as possible, and is only frozen/unfrozen once.</p>

<p>here's a ref that goes into detail of <a href=""https://www.home-barista.com/store-coffee-in-freezer.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a taste comparison between the frozen and fresh versions.</a></p>

<p>to quote from PAGE THREE (!) of this rich evaluation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maximizing your coffee's usable lifespan: Freezing is a viable method of preserving the freshness of very fresh coffee. Exactly how long the usable lifespan of coffee can be extended with freezing is unknown, although we do know that if frozen immediately that lifespan extends to at least 8 weeks. In this experiment, a very specific methodology was employed, and exactly how far one can deviate from it and expect to get good results is unclear. The previously frozen coffee we used was frozen immediately after roasting, within about an hour, in semi-airtight packaging in a very cold freezer (about -15°F / -26°C). It was then defrosted, only once, within the same packaging before it was exposed to outside air, reducing or eliminating the possibility of condensation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, for espresso - 8 weeks good.</p>

<p>A personal note: i've found a bag of my fave beens tucked in the back of the freezer 8m after putting it back there. Wow, i was so delighted with the flavour of the pour over - expecially when it was not that bean's season. Felt like cheating :) </p>

<p>SO why not try it yourself? you may be delighted months from now with the pleasure of out of season loved flavours.</p>

<p>2) another recent bit of work from bristol (i think) has been deliberately freezing the dose overnight before grinding. Bean bits seem to grind more evenly when frozen. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From an industrial perspective, the yield of extraction is paramount. Grinding colder coffee beans produces a more uniform particle distribution, with a decreased particle size. While the decreased particle size will tend to speed up extraction due to the larger surface area, the increased uniformity should minimise the amount of wasted bean, which is discarded without being extracted to completion. Whilst active cooling of either the coffee beans or burrs is energy consuming, the benefit of cold coffee grinding may offset this cost with more efficient extraction from the smaller particles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How bout that - and that this does something lovely for the taste. <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/srep24483"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">It's covered in Nature</a>! it must be true </p>

<p>PS - with storing roasted beans, since air is the big killer (more than even light - not much research shows light affects quality surprisingly) - there are a couple cans that are pretty good:</p>

<ul>
<li>vacu vin - <a href=""https://amzn.to/2WGzD4E"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this is a US amazon link to see it</a> -they make the type of canister you literally suck out the air with a hand pump -and this really does extra air - generally i put the bag into the container rather than loose beans - and then extract and when you take out the bag it's like it was vacume packed - cool!</li>
<li>coffeeVac - <a href=""https://amzn.to/2Gl3LwW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">another amz link for info</a> is pretty super too: less fussing around - but not a vacume - its lid presses air out. </li>
<li>Airspace <a href=""https://amzn.to/2MM2FeP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link again</a> is sort of like coffeeVac but more intrigued that coffeeVAC - the tin is stainless steel; the plunging lid pushes out potentially more air since it squihes down to the level of the coffee. </li>
</ul>

<p>in my experience using each of these all the time, the CoffeeVac is easiest to use, the VacuVin i trust the beans i care most about to - esp if wanting to keep them frech over a few weeks or more, and the Airspace - well i have it so i use it but it may be more intrigued than it's worth - with two lids: the plunger and then the top so nothing falls into the can.</p>

<p>Anyway, coffeeVac is likely most affordable and effective. </p>

<p>for me this double weighing is to check saturation of water by beans - seems like this device could make this process reuqire fewer steps.  </p>

<p>For instance - i like to make sure i'm getting at least a 2-1 water absorption relative to weight of beans. if the taste is less rich than i'd like before adjusting the amount or grind, it's a quick check to see how much water was actually absorbed by the bean - sometimes this absorption check tells me something about the age of the beans too - if they haven't degassed long enough they seem to absorp less - and that's even if the coffee slury is well stirred/no bubble in the slury.</p>

<p>It's also interesting in an abstract kind of way to see how absorption differs fro same grind, amount but different varieties. etc. </p>

<p>It's this kind of check that let me let the coffee sit a little longer after stir before doing a pour: higher absorption seems to relate nicely to richer flavour. </p>

<p>At least that's what i'm finding.</p>

Static electricity can build up between the grinder and the beans. - you'll note that the beans will also stick to the sides of whatever receptical they get ground into. </p>

<p>Here's <a href=""https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-Hack-to-Remove-Static-in-the-Coffee-Grinder/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one hack to fix this at the grinder stage</a>

4650,2,,2019-02-05T17:04:44.133,1,,"<p>As noted in the replies above, the receive wisdom is pretty much don't stir just - wet - bloom - pour more etc.</p>

<p>however, in terms of the science of coffee or its chemistry, you'll find that stirring is very much a Good Thing - by making sure you have in that wetting phase 3 times the water to bean ratio lets say, by a vigerous stir, what are you doing? you're helping to get the gas out and let the water in to start the process for extraction.</p>

<p>Stir for 10-15 secs (vigerous disagreements happen around this interval) </p>

<p>If you let the beans sit without a stir - the off gassing and thus the iportant bit: the absoprption to dissolution - is going to be - can't help but be - uneven. Which means some bean bits will be more extracted than others. </p>

<p>A sign you are on the path? The fewer bubbles post stir you see in the slurry the better the effect of the stir. </p>

<p>Let sit for another 30 secs - so this phase about 45 secs, then pour out - </p>

<p>This method is favoured by scott rao (<a href=""https://youtu.be/c0Qe_ASxfNM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">demo here</a> ), with a variant by matt perger (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/46612013"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">demo here</a> ). </p>

<p>It doesn't matter by the way about grind size and stirring (though why not use finer grind, higher temp and a stir) - the chemistry is pretty much the same: the goal is to get as even an absorption/wetting as possible, and simply pouring water on top of a mound of beans makes that simply impossible to hit all the grounds. </p>

<p>Also it doesn't matter about the water running through the grounds because they're disturbed - that this will cause week coffee. On the contrary. If you don't want to try this yourself, see vids linked above.</p>

<p>Here the  3 or 4 to 1 weight ratio, of water to beans for the stir ensures great effect: add water and go for 10-15 secs - the grounds all settle down again. Indeed, Rao will stir again or ""excavate"" as he calls it - after the pour is complete. and then swirl as well to get a nice flat even finish on the bed (example shown below from one of my pours). </p>

<p>But as we say in our lab : test it yourself - it's funner that way - and if you haven't - how do you know?<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pWCYH.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a></p>

<p>You can also check your work post pour to see how much water has been absobed from your pour. Double the amount of beans or better, pretty good.  </p>

4651,2,,2019-02-05T18:03:45.777,3,,"<p>As per Kyle above, YEs coffees fresher to roasting are expelling more gas than older ones that have degassed more. indeed a definition of staleness may include no more CO2 is released. </p>

<p>hitting beans with water shows that this gas is happening. But why bloom? that is supposed to get the gas out so water can come in. </p>

<p>Does it? if so for how much of what's ground? just cuz you get a mushroom effect does that mean all the grounds in there got wet??</p>

<p>there's a pretty good debate about ""blooming"" the coffee - and focussing on creating a bloom rather than focussing on really ""wetting"" the grounds </p>

<p>To this end, coffee afficianados like perger and rao among others are skipping the bloom and just stirring. </p>

<p>as a scientist gotta say i go with the chemistry of that: if the goal is even absorption of water by even release - agitating those grinds is going to to the business better than a bloom that offers little insight into the evenness of the wetting. Stirring ensures far less likelihood of channeling as water passes through too - would recommend reading/viewing rao on this point if interested. </p>

<p>so why not try it? forget bloom and just stir. see what that does to taste?</p>

<p>I've also found that coffees that are supposedly past their prime can be surprisingly flavourful given a good stir for ten secs and soak for another half minute and then the rest of the pour. </p>

<p>In other words another answer to the question ""what is coffee bloom"" - it may just be ""a ritualised futzing with CO2 gas in coffee that has little proven benefit for flavour extraction compared to stirring but provides more ""show"" for charging 4.50 at a coffee bar""?</p>

<p>best
m.c.</p>

<p>ps - a nice way to see if you've got the gas out of the fast 10sec stir of the slurry is that there are NO more bubbles coming out after that ten secs and as the coffee then sits for 30-45 secs total. </p>

4654,2,,2019-02-08T15:39:01.977,2,,"<p><strong>Bottom Line</strong>: When someone allows their coffee to bloom, they are pouring just enough hot water on the ground coffee to allow the gasses to be released but not so much that a lot of water starts dripping through.</p>

<p>The presence of CO2 is indicative that the ground coffee is fresh. However, we do not actually want CO2 in the coffee we drink. Therefore, it is important to let your freshly ground coffee ""bloom"" for one minute to allow the majority of the CO2 to be released to avoid sour tasting coffee that results from pouring over too quickly after grinding the coffee beans. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bloom is caused by the roasting procedure. Whenever coffee beans
  are roasted, the heat causes carbon dioxide (CO2) to become trapped in
  the bean. Once the roasted process is completed, the beans then begin
  to slowly discharge these gases a little bit at a time in a process
  known as “degassing.”</p>
  
  <p>If you are using coffee roasted in within a ten day time frame, much
  of the carbon dioxide will be retained by the beans even though the
  degassing process has begun. As soon as the beans are ground, the
  gases begin to escape much more quickly. When hot water touches the
  ground coffee, they immediately begin to purge themselves of the
  carbon dioxide creating the bloom effect.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about wasting grounds, either brew smaller batches of hot-brewed coffee, or look into cold-brewed coffee. Most groceries carry pre-made cold brew or cold brew concentrate (read the labels to see if added water or milk is recommended), or consider getting a brewing container to make at home in the fridge. It stays good for 7-10 days once brewed so you can purchase or make a week's worth at a time. </p>

Water is pretty easy to keep track of as long as you have water with a balanced pH and, preferably, filtered through magnesium. This has more so to do with taste. But, if your grind is not consistent, you're going to have a world of issues. It sounds to me like your grind is not fine enough. Or worse, you have some grind particles that are bigger than others. There are plenty of grinders out there that won't break the bank that can be used for consistent espresso grinding. </p>

<p>Pay attention to your tamping, too. If you're not tamping properly, you can get channels and the machine will not extract the loosely tamped grounds. Different coffees will have different viscosities, but for the most part, yes, it should be thick.  </p>

<p>Your shot time should be no less than 25 seconds. I have found the sweet spot to be around the 29-31 second mark. Especially if you're pulling doubles (16g-32g, 17g-34g, etc.). Keep practicing and keep watching videos. But first thing's first, buy a good grinder. </p>

<p>While roasting, during <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2172/quantifying-flavor-differences-between-varieties/2550#2550"">Maillard reaction</a>, the little pores in the coffee bean fills out with the emittted CO<sub>2</sub> together with traces of products of the Maillard reaction. These products are partially trapped within the bean together with CO<sub>2</sub>. Partially trapped means that they can still find cracks within the bean and going through the cracks they can go out of the bean~. Put this is limited*. Still, some flavor is trapped inside.</p>

<p>Then, when you grind the bean, you crack open all the holes and let the flavors carried together with CO<sub>2</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> molecule has a very small molecular mass^, so it really travels fast through the air to your nose.</p>

<p>Based on this story we can conclude that:</p>

<ul>
<li>bean characteristics</li>
<li>fresher roast</li>
<li>finer ground</li>

4683,2,,2019-03-02T04:30:35.083,0,,"<p>In case this question still lingers on yours or other users' mind ... Pressurized PF is not PS, so to speak, as long as the whole setup is operated well, including expectations of your own tastebuds.</p>

<p>1) First of all, get the FRESH COFFEE. Even preground, espresso grind, bricks could work ok if reasonably fresh (if you can tolerate too much Robusta). Older or stale coffee won't yield much crema.</p>

<p>2) Make yourself  a cup just with freshly boiled water, right in a cup,  kind of a la Turka (2tbl spoons or so per 6oz). Do you like the general flavor? You'll see some crema too, the fresher the coffee, the thicker the crema. If not, get other coffee beans.</p>

<p>3) Next, make sure your machine gets the water HOT ENOUGH (over 90C).</p>

<p>I assume that your machine is able to build up enough pressure to open up the flow through your pressurized PF.</p>

<p>4) Now, you should time how soon you get the flow after turning on the pump with EMPTY PF, that is no coffee in the basket at all. This gives you idea how long at minimum the coffee would brew while locked up in the basket. It would only continue to brew more after the flow begins.</p>

<p>5) Then, the trickiest part - ask yourself what sort of EXPECTED TASTE are you chasing. It's not trivial, many of us are not familiar with ""true"" espresso. Not only because it's subjective, but simply due to lack of available choices out there to compare. Lots of cafes standardise to the balance for the milk-based drinks, which masks a lot of flavor details. The result is your palate simply may not be ""calibrated"" for the raw shots.</p>

<p>In case you're just developing your taste, get some help from your equpment to taste some variations!</p>

<p>6) Load your PF to the top of the basket WITHOUT HEAP. How many tbl spoons? NO TAMPING.</p>

<p>7) Pull the usual shot, time how soon you get the flow.
Stop once the flow color is ""beige"" off-white.</p>

<p>8) EVALUATE. Any difference in the time vs. empty basket? How 'good' is the resulting brew (bitter, watery, strong, smell vs. the dry grounds) ? Any crema difference  vs. direct in-cup brew (color, thinckness, coverage)?</p>

<p>If too bitter, stop the flow sooner (remove the cup). Time it when the flavor is good for your taste. If too accid...your water may be too cold or just let it flow longer.</p>

<p>Is it enough volume for your liking? Personally, a single shot volume (1oz)  is not enough for myself, I like sipping it, not shooting.</p>

<p>9) Next, add MORE COFFEE, that is heaping it by one more teaspoon. Still no tamping, just level it a bit, tap-tap, or tamp lightly to fit just below the brim.</p>

<p>10) Do the shot. Evaluate.</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll figure out the amount of coffee you need to fit into your basket and how much tamping needed/possible. Also the results your setup can produce... Hopefully to your taste. And, well, more crema, if that's what your tastebuds ask for, though mostly it's just visuals, unless it's sippable before it gets smeared over the walls of the cup.</p>

<p>Another variation to try is PRE-INFUSION, basically delaying the full flow (if your machine allows you to interrupt the pump). This lets the coffee grounds expand/bloom a bit (3-5sec) before the gushing begins. Just compensate this by stopping the main flow sooner.</p>

<p>Variating the grind is more of fine-tuning, but you'd need a capable grinder. Btw, compare the preground coffee to what your grinder deems 'espresso', chances yours is coarser and dustier.</p>

<p>Anyway, espresso is no magic (mostly), it's just another way of having a taste that you enjoy. Find that taste! Make it repeatable. Keep your taste buds curious :)</p>

<p>Pressurized PF should help your journey, it's kind of equalizer, especially with the setup that you currently have. Espresso should be 'affordable' and liberating, otherwise it's just more viable to buy it directly from a cafe and barista that you like :)</p>

In grinders, like mist things, you get what you pay for, (and that includes coffee.) Absolutely no blade grinder should ever come in contact with a single precious coffee bean. The result is everything from fine dust to boulders. 
The quality and taste, body etc of a cup of coffee is determined by the amount of time the coffee is in contact with the coffee. That’s why fine grind espresso extracts in a few seconds and French press an average of four minutes. 
The key is to have a grind that is consistent in size with no dust and no boulders, match the method for brewing.
The ONLY way to achieve this is by purchasing a quality burr grinder. Don’t go cheap. Research it, check reviews and buy from a specialty coffee expert who can educate you in the great world of coffee. 
Quality estate grown coffee is grown and harvested with such care and so many important steps to ensure the highest standards are maintained from picking, through roasting and packaging. It never ceases to amaze me how so-called coffee lovers can ruin the whole process by how they store, grind, miss-match filtering methods to overdosing with cream and sugar. 
Great coffee is like fine wine. Where it’s grown, how it’s grown, how and when it is harvested, the roast, all go into yielding the best possible cup of coffee. Don’t screw it up by cutting corners when it comes to brewing it.
Lastly......never, EVER, put coffee in the freezer!!</p>

Burr grinders are much better, but try grinding finer, pressing harder to tamp your coffee down, and get the most consistent stuff out of your grinder you can (try scooping the fine stuff out of the bottom). Inconsistent bits will let the water sneak through the path of least resistance, making your coffee weak, bitter and run like water.  If you can't change the water temp, you can affect the contact time ( how long your grinds are in touch with the water) by changing the grind size. Using a spice grinder I usually grind for a few minutes and shake it upside down to loosen the soft stuff while grinding. </p>

<p>A) No, I can’t explain what caused the hole. It looks somewhat corroded and I wonder where the discoloration comes from - maybe worth checking the cause of that and the composition of your water? </p>

<p>B) I discourage repairing the hole in general. For two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>You’re operating the pot under pressure. Any repairs have to hold up to that and not just “hold the water in”.</li>
<li>Soldering and food safety are a tricky pair. You have to ensure that nothing can leach into the water that shouldn’t be there.</li>

<p>In short, you will need either experience beyond some household tinkering (which I kind of suspect you don’t have, because then you’d probably have patched it up already instead of asking here) or have to pay a professional - which considering the price of a new pot probably isn’t economical. (If this pot has a special emotional meaning, other considerations come into play, of course.)</p>

Many rules about making coffee are writen by perfectionists (or snobs or self-declared experts...) that are always on the hunt for the elusive <em>perfect</em> cup of coffee.

If you are unhappy with what your method produces, I would suggest giving the “official” order a try or start tweaking the various parameters. </p>

<p>Twist Press develops more pressure via a screw thread, but the thread appears to be at 45° which provides only 2x leverage, and you can't lean your weight on it, which is possible but not recommended for AeroPress.</p>

<p>The user presses the two handles towards each other, but that should just halve the pressing time, not increase the force. Is shorter brewing time important to making espresso (quick) taste? If so, why does this design have a closed cap for long brewing upside down?</p>

When I look at the grounds, there are primarily two depressions where it looks like most of the water is dripping and those depressions line up with bulges in the filter above, so I think that a disk replacement should produce a more even drip. However, I am not interested in buying disks to replace every month. We already have filtered water in our house. So I’ve been wondering if there is a filtration disk replacement that can be a permanent solution to producing an even drip. Perhaps a metal or plastic piece with holes in it similar to what I see on our old coffee maker where the drips came from.</p>

<p>I tried searching for such a product, but could not find one. Does anyone have another solution for this issue? Any tricks?</p>

4737,2,,2019-04-15T05:27:35.073,0,,"<p>Let me suggest different approaches that are much tastier, assuming that's your aim.</p>

<p>You can get individually sealed servings of ground coffee, ready to brew, packed without oxygen to stay fresh.</p>

<p>The best example I know of is <a href=""https://bluebottlecoffee.com/perfectlyground"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Blue Bottle Perfectly Ground"">Blue Bottle Perfectly Ground</a> coffee packets. I have not tried them but I can attest that their cafes serve great coffee. In your situation I'd try them.</p>

<p>Another variation is coffee pods, but pods are mostly waste though you only use a couple per week. There are compostable pods available but those might not be that much better. See <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/3061709/the-myth-behind-those-compostable-coffee-pods"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""The Myth Behind Those Compostable Coffee Pods"">The Myth Behind Those Compostable Coffee Pods</a> and look further into the composting situation.</p>

<p>Another approach would be to buy whole beans, premeasure them into individual servings, and pack those in little zip lock bags. Take out one at a time, let it thaw at room temperature before unsealing, and then grind it in a counter top or hand held burr grinder. Or grind them while still frozen if your grinder can handle that -- in fact research shows that they'll grind more evenly that way, according to. NY Times article.</p>

<p>People may tell you not to freeze coffee beans but in my controlled but limited experiments, freezing did not make a detectable difference in taste. Just don't remove some beans out of a frozen bag, letting air and moisture in, and put the bag back in the freezer where the air and moisture will decay the beans.</p>

<p>P.S. An Aeropress is a great way to make one or two cups at a time. I'm a big fan.</p>

<p>The main variable here are the beans; the process is of less importance. The main source of bitterness generally arises from beans that have been over roasted and have most of the flavor cooked out of them, unfortunately this is the case for many beans in popular places such as Starbucks and Peet’s. One quick way to tell is if the beans seem oily in the hopper; even worse if they have to chisel them off the sides of the grinder in order to grind them (not at all uncommon with these places). </p>

<ul>
<li>An environment with a low relative humidity and </li>

<p>So arrange your beans in a single layer on a rack or tray and find a “dry and windy” spot. The temperature can be even cool room temperature (dry surroundings and airflow are crucial, not temperatures), but may cooks prefer a low oven with the door slightly ajar. Up to 50 C won’t be a problem for the beans. Drying time depends on how wet the beans were - check on them regularly and turn them around on the tray.</p>

<p>To make proper espresso, you need 9 bars of pressure. To put that into perspective, that's about 131 lbs per square inch. I am guessing that there is no way the twist press can actually create that much pressure.</p>

<p>That being said, you will probably end up with something similar to what AeroPress or stovetop espresso (mokka) pot makes. Not quite espresso, not quite coffee. Its somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>When dealing with espresso, its not so much about the time as it is the flow of the liquid through the puck. It's about a constant water flow at the proper temperature with a consistent pressure for the duration of the extraction. I don't think there is anything in press market that will ever be able to attain that.</p>

<p>Another approach could be using percolators. By design, percolators reuse grounds over and over during brewing. So, you can dissolve a higher percentage of solubles with a percolator which fits your taste. If you don't care about the coffee to be more bitter, then you could go beyond 15%. As a result, you can use less grounds for the same amount of coffee. Actually, during instant coffee production this is what producers do. They brew less grounds for longer periods and end up bitter tastes.</p>

<p>The lumps you see in your jar are caused by moisture, which made some of the granules sticky. Maybe you left it open or used a damp spoon to scoop out some instant coffee? Try to break it up gently. If there’s only very little humidity, this should be fairly easy and could already solve the issue. If not, just use the lump(s) as you would the finer granules, they will dissolve in hot water without a problem. I suggest you are a bit more careful about <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/keep_one%27s_powder_dry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">keeping your powder dry</a> when handling the jar in the future. </p>

The quantity that ends up in the top chamber has started varying considerably. The pot is supposed to make enough for about two full cups, but sometimes only about half a cup's worth will come out and then it'll make the 'boiling over' sound that usually tells me it's done. If I try to keep it on the heat, it'll just keep furiously boiling and no more coffee will come into the top chamber. When I get a low yield, it'll always be really strong, so I can dilute it afterwards and the result is roughly the same, but it's still annoying.</p>

<p>I'm finding it very hard to pin down the variables that make it do this. Of course I always fill the bottom chamber the same amount - just below the valve. I have been varying the grind but I will get two wildly different results even between two brews using the exact same grind setting. I have now settled on a medium fine grind. I have switched from cold water to 90°C - but again, when I was trying both of those options out I was getting varying yields for each. The only thing that I don't keep all that precise control over is quantity of beans (I roughly fill to a finger over a certain marker in my grinder) but I don't see how that would influence things that much.</p>

<p>I must admit I don't understand very well the whole percolation mechanism (in my naive brain, it shouldn't work at all!) so I find it hard to reason through it. Any tips?</p>

4775,2,,2019-05-14T17:04:12.967,2,,"<p>I don't have experience with subscription programs, but I have looked at such programs. I think the following points should be addressed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Freshness</strong>. This is a major selling point. If your deliveries are roasted over a month ago (or even less if you're doing (bi-)weekly deliveries), you lose a lot of the appeal. Why would customers bind themselves to your program if they can get as fresh to-order?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability</strong>. Especially when you're doing more frequent deliveries (biweekly or even weekly) customers will rely on your delivery. That is, if I expect a delivery on Saturday, I won't stock other fresh coffee for the days after. So if your delivery runs late, I might run out (which is exactly what your subscription program should prevent).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Price</strong>. It has to be reasonably good value. In particular, you don't want to spend too much on shipping, as that means customers aren't getting good value for money. Obviously, as volumes per shipment get bigger this becomes less of an issue and as your programs serves a lot of customers you might get a better deal with the delivery companies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type of delivery</strong>. What I mean here is that the delivery should take little effort on the customer-end. For example, when I order beans they'll be delivered by someone ringing the door bell (because it's a big box), when I'm not home, they'll deliver to the neighbours or take it back. When you're sending small packages, make sure you customers don't need to be home, make sure it fits in / through the mailbox. That way, it will be there when they get home.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Payment</strong>. You probably want to offer a range of options. Some customers prefer to have a recurring payment that doesn't require them to authorise it for individual deliveries. Others like to pay per delivery or use pre-paid. Depending on payment options available in your country, you can offer a range of options.</p></li>

4777,2,,2019-05-16T23:37:36.560,4,,"<h3>Recommendation</h3>

<p>Since you want a bean-to-cup brew machine, you're limiting yourself quite a bit in terms of choice. That can be a good thing as it narrows down your options. </p>

<p>When to bean-to-cup brew machines I'd recommend the <a href=""https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/coffee/bdc650.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Breville Grind Control™</a>. It's not a commercial-size machine, but with only 6 people that would probably make it needlessly expensive. </p>

<p>Since I have no first hand experience with the machine, I recommend watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im8jAbAc4Vo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube video, again by SCG</a>, to get a good impression of the machine. Should you have machine-specific questions then I recommend asking those as a separate question.</p>

<p>As for price, it's advertised at around 300$ on Breville's website. </p>

<p>As for capacity, it's 60 oz (1.77L) machine. That means you can get 7 decent cups (250 mL / 8.45 oz) out of it.</p>

<p>You have some control on strength (in practice, more or less coffee going in) and grind size (finer or coarser grind). Furthermore, the can is insulated so your coffee keeps warm longer as opposed to machines that keep the can at a certain temperature (which eventually impacts taste).</p>

<p>The only criterium it doesn't meet is the ability to connect it to your water line. You might be able to make it work somehow, but it's not a feature of this machine (as opposed to others which are designed to be built into a kitchen or something).</p>

<p><strong>For non-Americans</strong>: note that the machine is rated for 110-120 volts. It may not work in places with higher voltages and I'm not sure if there's a higher voltage version of this machine. Just something to consider before buying.</p>

<hr>

<p>My answer consists of three parts. The first is an on-topic advice. The second is an option to get more information to better inform you which could be used to edit / ask a new question that is more refined. The last part is more of a comment which you should take note of in a purchasing situation.</p>

<h3>Advice</h3>

<p>Without knowing any more specifics, I understand that you don't want to spend a lot of money and that brew machines worked in the past but lacked capacity. I'm going to suggest getting multiple consumer-grade-ish brew machines, possibly with some fancier options (e.g. programmable turn on and off times). Since these features are so general, I cannot recommend a specific machine, but you can easily find some based on those criteria.</p>

<h3>Info on commercial grade</h3>

<p>Seattle Coffee Gear has a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c64MQKd61GI&amp;list=PLxsjzGY0Fi2SyoExt3c7L7WSNHgDKJ2rv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">playlist on YouTube dedicated to coffee makers for commercial use</a>. With your description, it's hard to give good advice, but I think you can get pretty far by going through all the videos (I am not affiliated with them, I just know they make good videos).</p>

<p>I suggest watching those videos to either settle on one of those options or to refine your criteria and post them here. Things you may want to specify:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Price (range)</p></li>
<li><p>Energy consumption</p></li>
<li><p>Brew versus espresso-based</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Comment on cleaning and maintenance</h3>

<p>As for cleaning, you're going to have to do some level of cleaning with any coffee machine. Can you minimise or automatise it? Yes, but never forget that it's there.</p>

<p>Also note that machines do sometimes break down or go out of the running because of maintenance. The best way to avoid that impacting your workflow too much would be to have multiple smaller machines (though that's not your question now).</p>

4779,2,,2019-05-21T13:11:36.433,1,,"<p>Yield and the quality of the brew depends on how water is pushed through the grounds. Some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>grind size</strong>: the finer the grind, the more pressure is needed to push water through. If you need to build more pressure, it may take longer to get to the same yield.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>grind consistency</strong>: this is related to grind size. If you have larger and smaller pieces in your ground coffee, you may get channelling. To get an idea of what happens, the smaller pieces may be lumped together needing relatively much pressure to push water through whereas the water can easily be pushed along the larger pieces. As such, an inconsistent grind can easily lead to an inconsistent brew (including yield).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>tamp pressure</strong>: do you tamp the grind (or do you level it out and push it with your fingers)? The more packed your grounds are, the more pressure is needed to push water through.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heat</strong>, how big you set your flame and how far you set your moka pot compared to the flame will influence how pressure builds. A very large flame with the moka pot directly above it will heat quickly and build pressure faster. This might result in a faster brew. You want to watch out though, you might end up heating the upper chamber too much making the first part of your brew burn making the whole thing needlessly bitter.</p></li>

4791,2,,2019-05-26T15:17:05.977,3,,"<p>Citric acid isn't very effective, it's even weaker than vinegar. Sage (Breville's trade mark in the UK) advertises with a descaling powder containing sulfamic acid (see someone who figured this out on <a href=""https://coffeeforums.co.uk/topic/41932-so-you-think-sage-descaler-is-expensive/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a forum</a>), which is a much stronger acid.</p>

<p>The weaker acids may be fine when they sit longer, for example when you're descaling the bottom of a kettle where the solution is in contact with the bottom for the duration of the descaling process. In more complicated espresso machines, you have tubes (metal or plastic) which may also have some deposits. Depending on the descaling process, the solution doesn't stay in those tubes very long, so you need to have a stronger solution that can clean the deposits there in that limited time window.</p>

<p>There are also aftermarket products that contain this acid (in power or liquid form). On my local Amazon, the powder goes for about 10US$ per kg (2.2 lbs). You need to make sure your machine can handle these, I think the ones with a stainless steel boiler can (at least the more expensive Breville machines are stainless steel, not sure about the cheaper ones).</p>

<p>Once you've settled on using this acid, you need to figure out dosage. I'd recommend following the dosage of the aftermarket solution or Breville's own powder and following the descaling instructions that came with your machine (or by looking up the manual online).</p>

<p>I surmise that you're using a steam pipe and you're frothing the entire drink with the espresso already in the cup. The problem you're experiencing (as I understand it) is that you don't get a nice emulsion, you get some water from the steam at the bottom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My grinder is a Bodum, also cost me about $100.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At that price point, it's probably a blade grinder. Blade grinders aren't good a producing a consistent grind: you'll get some larger pieces and some very fine dust. This is far from ideal when making coffee (in general) because the dust will overextract (leading to very bitter flavours) whereas the larger piece won't fully extract.</p>

<p>When making espresso, this is going to lead to a very fast extraction because the water chooses the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_least_resistance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">path of least resistance</a>. When the grind is uneven, that path is going to be around those larger pieces, meaning <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/4784/6506"">you'll get channelling</a>. </p>

<p>The best advice is to get a burr grinder and use the blade grinder for something else (e.g. <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1824/6506"">spices</a>).</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use a sieve to take out the very large pieces in your grind. This won't be as good as a good burr grinder, but at least you'll have less channelling because you have fewer very large pieces to give the water an easy way out. A paper towel technique (see YouTube link below) can be used to filter out the dust. The downside is obviously that this is quite tedious to do every time and you're trowing away a significant amount of coffee while you're at it.</p>

<p>To learn more about sieving and the paper towel trick, I'd recommend watching James Hoffmann's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y7d-5KWHCU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Coffee Hack: The Best Blade Grinder Results</em> on YouTube</a>.</p>

French press typically has larger grounds than even drip machines so that fewer particulates sneak their way through the mesh. Since you have already purchased it, I would recommend using slightly less espresso grounds as the smaller pieces allow for the coffee to be more compressed and also allow the coffee to rest a few seconds to a minute after pressing so the grounds can settle to the bottom. Avoid completely inverting the press when pouring and there should be less “mud” at the bottom of the drinkers cup.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be too worried about the grounds coming through the mesh, they almost certainly will. This is easily solved by pouring your coffee through a paper filter. I know don't normally do that for French press, but in this case it seems sensible to do so.</p>
<p>I'd be more worried about extraction time and taste. When I make French press, I grind as fine as possible without it becoming to bitter, with a consistent time the particles are still larger than holes in the mesh.</p>
<p>Since the coffee is already ground, you can play with two factors: time and dose. You probably want to use less time then you're used to. The dose is difficult, if you use too little coffee, you won't get a full body. If you use too much, it will taste very bitter.</p>

Present in coffee, tea, chocolate, and soft drinks as well as over-the-counter and prescription medications, it influences millions of users. This agent has achieved recent notoriety because its dependency consequences and addictive potential have been re-examined and emphasized. Caffeine's central actions are thought to be mediated through adenosine (A) receptors and monoamine neurotransmitters. The present article suggests that the olfactory bulb (OB) may be an important site in the brain that is responsible for caffeine's central actions in several species. This conclusion is based on the extraordinarily robust and selective effects of caffeine on norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and particularly serotonin (5HT) utilization in the OB of mice. We believe that these phenomena should be given appropriate consideration as a basis for caffeine's central actions, even in primates. Concurrently, we review a rich rodent literature concerned with A, 5HT, NE, and DA receptors in the OB and related structures along with other monoamine parameters. We also review a more limited literature concerned with the primate OB. Finally, we cite the literature that treats the dependency and addictive effects of caffeine in humans, and relate the findings to possible olfactory mechanisms.</p>

<p>Still, I advise you to check what you've changed recently. Check whether you've changed a setting or beans.

If this is not the case, please follow.</p>

4836,2,,2019-07-12T04:20:23.003,3,,"<p>As I said in a comment, I'll lay out a few factors that you need to experiment with. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I put the grind size very fine (a 3 or 4 on the dial) I'll get less during pre-infusion, but even less during the real extraction and also it'll be sour or whatever; you can't taste the flavour of the coffee. This happens both with the single filter and double filter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is the first factor: <strong>grind size</strong>. You can probably still tweak it a bit and you'll want to do so with the smallest step the machine allows. I don't know how many steps your machine has (my Oracle goes from 0 to 45, I think) and it allows a decent adjustment in grind size. It's not as good as a dedicated high-end espresso grinder, but it helps to to tune in the right direction pretty well.</p>

<p>If you're not extracting enough then you're grinding too fine or tamping too hard. So that's why I commented about <strong>tamping</strong> which is the second factor. Those two are related, if you grind super find but tamp it only very lightly then you'll still get a full extraction. The trick is to find a balance between the two and that can change from one bean to another. So instead of taming harder on the coarser grind, you can also try a finer grind with a gentler tamp.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Surprisingly the descale light has never come on, so I've never descaled it. I'm trying to keep the grounds even and I use the razor to even out the ground at the end (I blow out excess grounds dug up by the razor).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is yet another factor. The <strong>razor</strong> is probably good for reproducibility, assuming it doesn't ruin what remains in the filter. On the other hand, you might benefit from a bit more coffee in the basket, especially when you're using a slightly coarser grind. So this is also a factor to experiment with.</p>

<p>Finally, there's the <strong>extraction time</strong>. While it's often advised to have about 30 seconds of extraction time, it's certainly not set in stone. Too long and you may get a bitter cup and too short probably won't get enough volume in the cup (or not enough pressure) but it's something to try.</p>

<p>For example, I've had ristrettos taking 40 to 45 seconds on a 1:1 ratio with a fine grind that were nice and sweet. Indeed, had I stopped those shots at 20 to 25 seconds then they would've been sour similar to your description of the very fine grind.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would use a finer setting for the grounds, but my pressure after pre-inf is already very high. Like how is water flowing through the portafilter equally fast with and without pressure? I don't understand the physics of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In reply to this comment, it depends on how your machine does pre-infusion. For example, the Oracle builds pressure normally but it has a relieve valve that you can set at a percentage of the normal / maximum pressure. The minimum for my setting is 55%, so it certainly builds some pressure during pre-infusion. </p>

<p>As for the flow rate, it probably isn't flowing as much at the lower pressure. You could obviously compare the time and even compare with an empty basket, that'll flow a lot faster (at least on my machine it does).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've had the machine for 6 months. Surprisingly the descale light has never come on, so I've never descaled it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's probably a good idea to descale regularly anyway. It depends on the hardness of your water, and it's probably not the culprit here, but I'd try to make it a habit to do at regular intervals (monthly, or bimonthly depending on water quality).</p>

The first and easiest thing you can do is to drink as much coffee as you can and explore the vast world of flavor profiles and complexities of different coffees around the world have to offer. Maybe one day go find a shop selling a Yergacheve or a Genji from Ethiopia and next go find a Sumatra or Papua New Guinea. Recognizing this kind of dichotomy will help you to find major differences in coffee and eventually sharpen your palate.</p>

<p>There is, in fact, a science behind tasting coffee. It's been said in studies that when we taste things we associate them with a color. If you taste butter, you might see yellow. If you taste kale, you might see green, etc. The SCA has a great visual representation of this. You can find it on google or on their website. I would use that as guide. </p>

<p>Also, eat more food and fruits. Get more familiar with food. When you look at the color wheel, you'll probably notice a lot of flavors or fruits that you've never even heard of. Eating more food can help you train your palate for tasting coffee. </p>

<p>Lastly, there is both a subjective and objective aspect to tasting coffee.  If you were drinking a Kenyan coffee and said, ""I taste green apple,"" then objectively speaking, you're tasting what is known as Malic Acid. If you tasted grape, tartaric acid, and so on. This does not come easily or quickly, but keep with it. Don't, out of potential discouragement, start saying you taste things just to say that you taste them. Allow your brain to adjust and sooner than later you'll be a whole lot better at being able to distinguish flavors in coffee.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Preparing coffee is a physical and chemical process (although some aficionados will claim that it’s an art) where soluble compounds (“flavors”) are dissolved in water. The coffee bean contains various compounds that dissolve at different speeds, with acidic flavors being quickest and bitter notes, e.g. tannins slowest. </p>

<p>Without going into the details:</p>

<ul>
<li>An under-extracted coffee will be acidic, and missing the “fullness” from the coffee oils.</li>
<li>In a just right extraction, acidity will be a side note to a full body of coffee oils and sugars with a bit of bitterness for balance.</li>
<li>An over-extracted coffee will be unpleasantly bitter, masking the desired flavors, and sometimes even with an astringent mouthfeel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The beans, roast, grind size and brewing method are all parameters that influence the ratio of aromatic compounds and/or rate of extraction, but the principle described above remains. <a href=""https://clivecoffee.com/blogs/learn/how-coffee-extraction-works"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clive Coffee</a> has a neat blogpost on the topic and there’s even a Wikipedia article on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_extraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">coffee extraction</a>.</p>

<p>But I have a suggestion (gleaned from the back of my jar of cardamom pods). Instead of using a spoonful of ground cardamom, consider getting cardamom pods, squeezing 2 or 3 of them to crack them a little bit and placing those in your coffee cup.  It definitely augments the taste of the coffee in the positive direction, plus you're not eating ground cardamom. </p>

<p>If there are any holes, you probably want to clean it and make sure it's dry (dry it in the oven at a low temperature, 50°C (122°F) should be enough to help any water evaporate without damaging components). Then close the hole (with some of your welding technique?) and test it again. The reason you don't want a hole is that it's harder to keep clean and can be a nice spot for bacteria or other nasty stuff to settle.</p>

<p>The Nescafé is not coffee in the sense of coffee beans, ground, ready for brewing. It’s <em>instant</em> coffee, which means coffee was brewed and then freeze-dried. The resulting granules can then be put in hot water to create a coffee drink (although some fundamentalist would dispute the claim that the result qualifies as “coffee”, but I digress). Think of it as the coffee-equivalent of a bullion cube. If you put that in your machine, you would - at best - get a weird result and possibly damage it.</p>

<p>What you need for the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"" rel=""noreferrer"">Moka</a> (the kind of stovetop espresso maker you got) are <strong>real coffee beans</strong>. Either you get whole beans plus a grinder or you buy pre-ground beans. Some will frown upon the latter, but if you are totally new, it should be ok as a start and I recommend it. Read the labels, because ground coffee comes in different grind sizes, but mainstream Italian coffee brands like Lavazza, Illy, Segafredo and the other usual suspects will for example put a little symbol on the packs showing a Moka like yours, indicating a suitable grind. </p>

<p>Apart from that, follow the instructions that (hopefully) came with your coffee maker, e.g. fill the bottom chamber to the fill line (or just under the valve if not line is given), fill the coffee grounds chamber (the funnel-thingy) flush, but don’t compress, remove from the heat when it starts making gargling noises...</p>

<p>The Nescafé is the same as the one-serving sachets you mentioned before, so if you are ok with that, you can still use it up when you don’t want to pull out the Moka. Although I suspect once you have come to appreciate a good coffee from fresh beans, you won’t want to go back to instant.</p>

<p>I can think of two possible reasons for the double wall, but I must say, that double wall is an unnecessary added expense on the unit no matter the reason it was included...</p>

<p>1) In a double wall design, the exterior wall will cool down faster than a single wall would, since the exterior wall does not maintain contact with hot water. This means you can safely reuse the steamer sooner. This is kind of silly, though, since you can easily cool a single walled steamer by briefly running it under cold water.</p>

<p>2) A double walled steamer is more structurally durable than a single walled steamer. These units are sometimes built to withstand very significant internal pressure. The double wall could be part of such a design. This is kind of silly itself because steam pressure higher than a single walled unit could support is dangerous...</p>

4865,2,,2019-08-17T02:00:07.287,1,,"<p>I've tasted some ""major"" flavor themes in coffee before. Chocolate, brown sugar, nuts, even fruity flavors. It's rare, though. It takes a very careful brew with just the right water and just the right brew execution. I've only ever tasted it with espresso and near-espresso (percolator, Aeropress, etc.) brews and only when literally everything about the brew process, water, and grind is close to perfect.</p>

<p>Things that affect coffee flavor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maturity of beans when harvested</li>
<li>Age of beans when roasted</li>
<li>Time since roasting when ground</li>
<li>Time since ground to brew</li>
<li>Consistency of the grinder (i.e., few to none fines or large bits)</li>
<li>Water solutes</li>
<li>Water TDS (total dissolved solids)</li>
<li>Water temperature for brew</li>
<li>Altitude (moreso if using a being method that requires steam)</li>
<li>Mass of grinds used</li>
<li>Consistency of exposure of water to grinds</li>
<li>Duration of exposure of water to grinds</li>
<li>Time from brew to consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>To add to this mess of complexity, there is no single value for any of these inputs that can assigned. Often, adjusting one factor can compensate for another otherwise bad factor.</p>

<p>You <em>do not</em> need freshly roasted beans to do this. Beans can't be stale, but ""just roasted"" is not a requirement.</p>

<p>You also <em>do not</em> need an expensive grinder. Something like a Capresso Infinity can work wonderfully well, especially if you choose to use a sieve that matches your brewing method.</p>

<p>And even if all the material variables are spot on perfect, some stupid little thing like atmospheric pressure can muck with your perfect brew.</p>

<p>Espresso is the most consistent way to achieve this if you have a unit with multiple thermostats and pressure regulators.</p>

<p>An Aeropress is easier than a cheapo espresso machine that lacks those controls.</p>

<p>A moka pot (percolator) is easier than an Aeropress but requires a stove to use (unless you splurge on an electrical one with a thermostat and steam regulator--I don't even know if such a thing exists).</p>

<p>And if you have bad water, sorry. There's literally nothing you can do short of filtering it and then adding minerals back in to get a good TDS.</p>

<p>Also, everyone's sense of taste is different. I can name at least five ingredients in almost anything I eat by taste. Most people do not have such sensitive taste receptors. It could we'll be that most people simply can't taste those flavors in coffee no matter how it's made.</p>

The way beans are roasted (and the selection procedure that the roaster uses) can make any steps you take when brewing moot.</p>

<p>As for your question, the easiest way to find out would be to taste coffees in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blinded</a> cupping. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_cupping"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cupping</a> is a way of tasting where the brew procedure is set (e.g. by the <a href=""https://sca.coffee/research/coffee-standards"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Speciality Coffee Association</a>), using as little variations that may affect the taste of the coffee. The reason this is done is to enable comparing multiple coffees with the brewing method being as little of a factor as possible. The blinded aspect means tasters don't know which coffee they're tasting. For example, each tasting participant could be assigned coffees as a number.</p>

<p>During the cupping, tasters fill in a standardised form, which considers a number of aspects: smell, taste, and flavor, among others. When the cupping is finished, the forms can be collected and compared. Based on the results, one can determine if the tastes are there or just made up.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for the general question whether those tastes can be there. The answer is simply yes. The reason for that is that many fruits have a distinct aroma because of a class of chemicals called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester#Applications_and_occurrence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">esters</a>. These esters are used in the food industry, for example as artificial flavourings. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> describes their formation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an ester is a chemical compound derived from an acid (organic or inorganic) in which at least one –OH (hydroxyl) group is replaced by an –O–alkyl (alkoxy) group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such an acid is found in green coffee beans, and when roasted, these form esters which may be tasted (but don't have to be, or may be burnt of during roasting). From ScienceDirect on chlorogenic acid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chlorogenic acid was isolated from green coffee beans. It has also been found in the seeds and leaves of many dicotyledonous plants. It is thermally unstable and is readily decomposed to quinic acid and caffeic acid. Chlorogenic acid accounts for 5–10% of coffee beans, which is a much larger amount than caffeine (1–2%). Chlorogenic acid strongly influences the taste of coffee, such as astringent, sweet, and sour tastes, which change with the concentration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that chlorogenic acids (GCAs) are a group of acids, this thesis (<a href=""http://edepot.wur.nl/122022"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coffee Brew Melanoids</a>) illustrates their variety in coffee:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than 44 different CGAs were already identified in green coffee beans with 5-
  caffeoylquinic acid (Figure 2) being the most prevalent one (10-12). The group of Clifford
  specialized in CGA characterization and they wrote a review on CGAs (8). </p>

<p>Coffee is a fruit, a sort of cherry that can grow in wet or dry, temperate or cool climates. The climate of a location and the specific times of planting and harvest will affect the flavor of the coffee bean itself (which is the seed of the fruit).</p>

<p>But there are other factors that affect the flavor to greater degrees. How the seeds are processed (removal of the fruit and drying of the beans) after harvest is perhaps the biggest factor. Of course roasting, staleness of beans when brewing, and brewing factors all also play significant roles in the final taste of drinkable coffee.</p>

<p>It's close to impossible to control for all these factors. Specialty coffees can typically each be sourced to a single farm and a single harvest because that's the only way to ensure consistent processing of the beans. But even then, logistics of sourcing present challenges to consistently roasting and brewing those beans. And changing climates across the globe will challenge preconceived notions of ""where the best coffee comes from"" as we move into a bleak future.</p>

4885,2,,2019-09-06T08:55:07.517,2,,"<p>I can’t give you an answer based on tasting the authentic product, but:</p>

<p>The various “brown” or “raw” sugars are characterized by the molasses content, which is part of the original cane sugar juices. This juice has a characteristic flavor profile with notes reminiscent of caramel and malt. In the production of white sugar, they are filtered out, leaving behind the white “just sweet” sugar. </p>

<p>The darker (and sometimes “wetter”) a brown sugar is, the higher the molasses content and the more extra flavor components are in the sugar. In cooking and baking, brown sugars are often used not just as sweetener, but also for the flavor. </p>

<p>The logical conclusion regarding your question is: If brown sugars are used in not-just-minute amounts, they will be noticeable. So the flavor of the Cuban coffee will and should be different from espresso with white/refined sugar. How intense the brown sugar flavor is, depends on how much sugar is used per serving and how dark it is. The term “natural brown sugar” in your source suggests a rather intense flavor, which should be quite similar to jaggery.</p>

<p>When you roast coffee beans, the beans undergo chemical changes that create the desirable flavor components. When you afterwards grind the beans and brew your coffee, the flavor components are extracted into the water. If (whole!) beans you bought are not roasted enough for your liking, you can try to re-roast, although the results may not be exactly what you were aiming for. Theoretically possible nevertheless.</p>

<p>Now, for instant coffee you need to remember that instant coffee is <em>not</em> finely-ground coffee beans, but <em>prepared (=brewed and filtered)</em> coffee that has been freeze-dried, clumps up into small granules and can be reconstituted by adding water. The beans that are changed in the regular roasting process simply aren’t there in instant coffee, which is why you won’t be able to develop the desired flavors by roasting instant coffee. You may be able to create some burnt flavors, but I don’t think that’s what you want. You should also note that the instant coffee granules are not very stable and likely to break up and, depending on your home-roasting method and tools, may clog up and damage your equipment.</p>

Too course and water will flow faster and produce weaker coffee, too fine and its difficult for water to pass through, when you remove the filter holder, the remnants should not be 'muddy and wet' but firm and dryish.  If you grind your own coffee, use a quality variable texture grinding machine. Also compare with commercially ground coffee which is normally like fine beach sand. </p>

4914,2,,2019-09-21T17:59:43.267,5,,"<p>Caffeine content of coffee varies widely depending on many factors. How much caffeine does your 10 cups contain? And how much is too much? The Mayo Clinic website has addressed exactly what you are concerned about in their detailed article which can be read here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678</a></p>

<p>Important extracts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much is too much?
  Up to 400 milligrams (mg) of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults. That's roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two ""energy shot"" drinks. Keep in mind that the actual caffeine content in beverages varies widely, especially among energy drinks.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>You may want to cut back if you're drinking more than 4 cups of caffeinated coffee a day (or the equivalent) and you're experiencing side effects such as:</p>
  
  <p>Migraine headache</p>
  
  <p>Insomnia</p>
  
  <p>Nervousness</p>
  
  <p>Irritability</p>
  
  <p>Restlessness</p>
  
  <p>Frequent urination or inability to control urination</p>
  
  <p>Stomach upset</p>
  
  <p>Fast heartbeat</p>
  
  <p>Muscle tremors</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Most adults need seven to eight hours of sleep each night. But caffeine, even in the afternoon, can interfere with this much-needed sleep.</p>
  
  <p>Chronically losing sleep — whether it's from work, travel, stress or too much caffeine — results in sleep deprivation. Sleep loss is cumulative, and even small nightly decreases can add up and disturb your daytime alertness and performance.</p>
  
  <p>Using caffeine to mask sleep deprivation can create an unwelcome cycle. For example, you may drink caffeinated beverages because you have trouble staying awake during the day. But the caffeine keeps you from falling asleep at night, shortening the length of time you sleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's also my personal experience as a long-time coffee 'addict', though I am also very sensitive to caffeine and therefore I can tolerate just 2 cups a day before I lose sleep and begin to experience strong physical effects. The key thing is to make sure you don't experience symptoms of caffeine excess, and that you get adequate sleep every day, which also varies from person to person. </p>

<p>If you feel the need to reduce your coffee intake, the same article linked above provides some useful guidelines.</p>

Black coffee has a pH about 5, baking soda around 9, but it buffers the coffee enough that the soy won't curdle.  It works for other curdling plant milks as well, I just prefer the soy.  I do not notice that it changes the flavor, although too much probably would. But you just need a small pinch, smaller than a peppercorn.  Anyone watching their sodium intake should count it.  I read the label on the soy creamer trying to figure out why their product didn't curdle when plain soy milk did, and sodium bicarbonate was the ingredient that made sense. It works hot or cold, but too much in a hot cup of coffee gives a nice fizzing reaction.  A few more bubbles for your froth! </p>

<p>Instant coffee is hygroscopic, it will absorb moisture from the air if possible. I guess either someone was sloppy when scooping out the instant coffee and used a wet spoon or the container was not airtight (either bad packaging design or because a careless user didn’t close the pack properly). Now add high humidity to the mix and you will get the lump as seen in your post.</p>

<p>There are at least three reasons<sup>1</sup> to discard this container.</p>

<p>A) It’s a pain to pry it out and to dissolve it, as you have already observed. Pouring hot water straight into the container may help, but then there’s:</p>

<p>B) The flavor is almost certainly not pleasant any more (see <sup>1</sup>). </p>

<p>C) But the most important factor is food safety. If the granules got humid, there is a certain probability of bacterial and/or fungal growth and I would really recommend to discard the (ex-)coffee.

<p>Normally, Coffee has a shelf-life about 3-9 months, depending on if its ground, whole, flavored, and how and where its stored.<br>

This is right in line with the other articles and what I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Those are all recommendations, and there is good reason.  Usually with any vacuum seal there is some oxygen that gets into the product and that will cause it to degrade over time.  The oxygen is part of the air, which may also contain some moisture.  The moisture will also degrade the product over time, creating an environment for bacteria to grow in.  Bacteria needs oxygen and moisture to grow, and the reduced oxygen slows down the process of spoilage and creates an environment to limit the growth, while also limiting the evaporation of any moisture in the food (thus it retaining its flavor).<br>
Also, the vacuum seal can and will degrade over time itself eventually letting in some oxygen and moisture.  This is different depending on the packaging and type of seal.  This is based on the manufacturer of the vacuum seal as well, though some are better than other, often the manufacturer will put a date/time on the seal knowing it will last longer than that but that is the less than minimum, so that way its not an issue when the seal does give.</p>

<p>Typically, when coffee goes bad there could be some mold <strong>IF</strong> its exposed to moisture for a long period of time, but usually it would just lose its flavor and possibly some of the caffeine.  You can tell if its gone bad by the smell when you open it.  If when you opened it, and it smells of mildew or mold, then its definable bad, and that would be bad to drink.  If its just odorless and bland smell, then it is probably still good to drink, but probably won't have any flavor.  Coffee like that, will not be harmful to you, just not be ""good"" to taste (but also probably not ""bad to taste either).  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though I did find some very fine lint type things inside. If you ask me it looks like the ends of a dandelion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That could have been some of the beans breaking down, or just a bean that got crunched in the packaging a while ago.  Depends on the coloration and smell and such.  Personally, I would try that at all.</p>

<p>If you already brewed it and didn't find any bad taste, smell or feeling from drinking it, then its probably good.  Additionally, you could also blend this coffee with other fresh coffee, assuming its still ""good"" based on the above.  </p>

However, when I tried this the initial volume of water from the spout erupts out in both directions with such ferocity that it actually leaves the pot entirely and drenches the stove on either direction. </p>

<p>In every video I have seen they seem to have a nice gentle flow that merely dribbles out of the spout and falls down the spout into the chamber. My one is more like a volcano!</p>

<p>I have tried using a lower setting on the hob - there are 6 settings. At the very lowest (#1) it doesn't boil at all. At settings 3-6 I get a huge jet of water as described above. At setting #2 I get a smaller jet of water (that still shoots out of the pot) however on this setting the water seems to stop boiling up from the lower chamber leaving me with half a cup of coffee.</p>

It's a single cup aluminium Moka pot which hadn't been used regularly for maybe a year until the last few weeks when I have been using it regularly. I took it apart earlier today and gave everything a good scrub. Still no difference.</p>

Here's what I've found works best for me. My grinder (DBM-8) dispenses around 22 grams of coffee on the 4-cup setting and around 40 grams on the 6-cup setting. I use 350 mL of water for the former and 640 mL of water for the latter. When I am brewing an amount like 22 grams, I find I get the best tasting coffee if I keep the coffee maker on its bold setting and use a <strong>cone-shaped paper filter</strong> (though the machine is meant to use basket-shaped filters). Otherwise, the coffee may be watery. When I am brewing a larger amount, like 40 grams, it doesn't matter, the coffee will taste fine either way. </p>

<p>There was a lot of detective work done earlier on, as covered in various comment threads. But I think the simple conclusion is that the pathway for the water to percolate through the grounds is too short when brewing a small amount of coffee with a basket-shaped filter.</p>

<p>The solution is easy, make sure the equipment is cleaned well, a bit of soap does wonders to remove oily residuals.</p>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>You may be using large equipment to make a small amount of coffee. That way, when you're pressing down the strainer is already near the bottom of your container meaning you cannot press much further. To solve this, try using a container of an appropriate size. If your French press is filled at least halfway at step 4 then this shouldn't be an issue, if it's much less, consider making a larger batch or using a smaller French press.</p>
<h3>Blooming</h3>
<p><a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/348/6506"">Blooming</a> is technique for letting gasses (mainly carbon dioxide) escape the coffee beans. I don't think this is what causing you trouble, but I think it's worth mentioning. To get a good bloom, you just need to take some time between step 4 and step 5. After stirring the beans, you wait 30 to 60 seconds to allow some of the gasses to escape.</p>

4971,2,,2019-10-29T09:56:03.670,2,,"<p>So, it's kind of complicated. To understand why the hole area is important, we need to consider how an espresso is made and what it takes to taste good.</p>

<h1>When does coffee taste good?</h1>

<p>Making coffee is the processes of extracting water solvable compounds from the coffee grounds. Some taste good, some don't. The trick is to extract the right amount of each. You can control this by how much and how long the water touches the coffee grounds. Too much water and bitter, nasty compounds are extracted. Too short and only sour and volatile compounds end up in the water. You want the right balance for that delicious espresso you have come to love.</p>

<h1>Setting up the ideal coffee puck</h1>

<p>Espresso is about extracting coffee flavors from the small coffee particles. We want to extract each particle exactly as much. To do so, you carefully grind the particles to a certain size. The reason why people buy expensive burr grinders is to make the particle size distribution as narrow as possible (so all coffee grounds have the same size, so water touches the same surface area). You tamp the coffee in the filter basket as level as possible. Ideally, all particles are the same size and the density of coffee is homogeneous in the whole coffee puck (achieved by proper distribution and tamping level). Then water is pressed trough the puck at 9 bars of pressure. Ignoring the filter basket, the flow rate trough the puck will be the same everywhere.</p>

<h1>It's about flow rate</h1>

<p>The water will take the path of least resistance (lowest density, largest holes). So if you've carefully set up your puck to have a perfect particle distribution and homogeneous density but the holes in your filterbasket vary in size, more water will flow trough the larger holes. More water passes trough that path and the coffee above, therefore extracting those parts of the coffee puck more. This is an uneven extraction and deviates from the ideal where every particle is extracted exactly as much.</p>

<p>To get a homogeneous water resistance, we try to give the holes the same surface area. This ensures that if you have the perfect puck, water will flow evenly throughout.</p>

<p>When I bought my Strada basket, <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x9T0Q.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">it came with a histogram showing the hole size distribution</a>, which I think is pretty cool. You can see how narrow that Gaussian is, and it was a noticable improvement from the filter baskets that came with the machine.</p>

4972,2,,2019-10-29T18:57:29.357,1,,"<p>The simplest is an infusion-based method. Since you start from whole beans, you will have to grind them, but when that's done it's just steeping them in water. According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeemaker#History"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia on coffee maker history</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For hundreds of years, making a cup of coffee was a simple process. Roasted and ground coffee beans were placed in a pot or pan, to which hot water was added, followed by attachment of a lid to commence the infusion process. Pots were designed specifically for brewing coffee, all with the purpose of trying to trap the coffee grounds before the coffee is poured. Typical designs feature a pot with a flat expanded bottom to catch sinking grounds and a sharp pour spout that traps the floating grinds. Other designs feature a wide bulge in the middle of the pot to catch grounds when coffee is poured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is really simple, it's just four simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Grind the beans. The quality of the grinder and choosing the correct grind setting will influence the result a lot.</p></li>
<li><p>Add ground beans and hot water to a pot. Water should be just of the boil, pour water in the container first to heat the pot, similar to the process for a French press.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait until the infusion has reached the desired level. Again, basically the same as the French press method.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour the coffee from the pot into a cup leaving most of the grounds in the pot.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This method has most of the benefits of the French press with less cleaning up because there is no built in strainer.

<li><p><strong>Paper filtered</strong>: drip brew tends to be filtered by paper of cloth, filtering out oily components.

<blockquote>
  <p>The most efficient extraction of fatty acids was performed with French Press extraction. Brewing with a paper filter resulted in coffee with the lowest fatty acid content, which is consistent with the findings of Peters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, this doesn't apply to all drip brews, metal filters don't filter out oily components.</p></li>

I am neither a doctor nor a chemist.<br>
The following statements rely heavily on the <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorogens%C3%A4ure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">German Wikipedia article on chlorogenic acid</a> and some other sources that are typically considered trustworthy (e.g. <a href=""https://pubchemdocs.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/about"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PubChem</a> and others citing studies.<br>
Individual reactions may vary.</em></p>

<p>So we have two suspects that may or may not be responsible for stimulating your digestive system.</p>

<p><strong>Chlorogenic acid</strong> sounds like a good candidate for stomach issues (being an acid), but in animal testings it actually helped against ulcers and there are no indicators of other plants containing chlorogenic acid causing problems.<br>
High contents in coffee can be tasted and the content is significantly influenced by the roasting method, slow roasting at temperatures around 200C will break it down, which will additionally make the coffee taste milder. I suspect that the perceived flavor contributes to the ascribed properties that are sometimes mentioned on more popular (non-scientific) websites. But I assume that it’s not the chlorogenic acid per se, but the general roasting method and bean quality that matters here.</p>

<p><strong>Caffeine</strong> on the other hand is a proven stimulant, which affects the nervous system - including the peristaltic movement of the colon, causing the known effect of urgent bathroom trips up to diarrhea. It’s also an - albeit weak - diuretic, resulting in frequent urination. The symptoms you describe in your question are classic caffeine effects. If you are suffering, the dose is too high for you to stomach (pun intended). You can develop a tolerance (we have some Q/As on the topic here on the site), but reducing the dose or skipping the caffeine is the logical way of avoiding the effects. </p>

<p>So my conclusion: 
If you want a “mostly harmless” drink, go for decaf and don’t worry too much about chlorogenic acid. If you want a mild coffee and are ok with the caffeine effects, go for slow-roasted - which I would generally recommend. 
Finding a coffee with <em>both</em> properties may be a good reason to get familiar with your local roaster instead of buying at the supermarket.</p>

<h3>Temperature</h3>
<p>Temperature is probably the most important factor here. You don't want the temperature to be too low, when that's the case you won't be able to extract all that you want. You can easily ensure you're not using water that's too cold, either by pouring straight from the kettle (goose-neck or otherwise) or by preheating the pouring vessel (e.g. your pouring cup).</p>
<h3>Control</h3>
<p>Control is important for pour over brews, but it's not absolutely necessary. You can simply use a regular kettle to pour but you'll have less control over the flow rate (how fast water flows out) and where you irrigate the grounds.</p>

<p>Of course, you won't find many filters for this purpose, but you can make do with a round paper filter of roughly the size of the basket. For espresso, I use AeroPress filters which I soak under the sink before applying them to the filter basket (before adding grounds). </p>

<p>In your moka pot case, I'd also suggest wetting the paper and applying it on top of the grounds. Given that the grounds are a bit finer than you prefer, I woud use a bit less grounds and push the paper filter onto the grounds before screwing the top on. </p>

<p>The paper filter should ensure no grounds make it into the drink but it <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/2259/6506"">may impact also impact the mouth feel of the drink</a>. When I make espresso with an added paper I still get crema, but I'm not sure how much of the oils will get through without the espresso-level of pressure.</p>

<p>Edit: I see another answer also suggested this and focuses on the danger of clogging up. I think that's a valid concern given the finer consistency. If that's something you're really worried about, it's easy to solve by mixing in something coarser that doesn't affect your drink. That way, contrary to mixing in coarser coffee (which you may not have, and may lead to uneven extraction), you could add some inert grainy stuff. I'd suggest some sort of sand, but you'd have to be sure that it's food safe. By goolging, I've found that there are some food-grade sands out there and if you have that on hand it might be an interesting experiment.</p>

<p>If your new to coffee, I would suggest starting out with an Arabica coffee in a variety of roasts.  Arabica is the type of bean that grows in higher elevation and has a longer grow cycle leading to a richer and fuller flavor.  Starbucks is obviously popular and it's where I got my start when I worked there, but there are a lot of other good options.  If you have local roasters in your town or city, check them out.  A lot of local coffee shops roast their beans in house these days and they can be a good place to start.  If you don't have that option, maybe go with something like Peet's Coffee, or Caribou in the grocery store.  Seattle's Best is cheap, but it's also owned by Starbucks and is basically their second rate coffee and way-overly roasted in my opinion.</p>

<p>As far as the americano  or latte you're going for, I'm not sure how that will work with an aeropress as I've only really used espresso machines to make them, but you're going to want a dark roast for those as the coffee is condensed into a 1 ounce shot and diluted with water or milk respectively.  Go for a good quality espresso roast (Illy is a great choice but is pretty pricey), or something like an Italian Roast.  I would avoid going too dark (like a French Roast), but that's up to your taste preference.  </p>

4993,2,,2019-11-16T16:29:58.347,2,,"<p>The short answer is no.  Drip coffee is made by running the water through the grounds in a paper or mesh filter.  This is a gravity-based brewing method used in most standard coffee makers and pour overs.  An Americano is an espresso-based drip-like beverage.  It's made by pulling espresso shots and adding them to hot (or cold if you're into that kind of thing) water.  The flavors will be different as well. For example, drip coffee will tend to have a stronger flavor, while an Americano will usually be a bit smoother depending on how strong you make it.</p>

General purpose coffee is ground for drip brewing, and French press uses coarser grinds (partly so you don't get so much sludge in your cup and partly to minimize overextraction from long brew times). The filter is designed for those coarse grinds and will clog with finer grinds like drip.</p>

<p>Avoid this by grinding your own coffee (many grocers offer in-store grinders with bulk coffee) or buying pre-ground coffee in French press grind. Pressing should never require a significant application of force. If you press hard, the pressure can be released suddenly and cause an explosive release of hot water and coffee, like you describe in the question.

5003,2,,2019-11-27T20:14:14.480,3,,"<p>The clear answer: It depends.</p>

<p>First, not all fully automatic models are constructed in the same way. Which also means the required effort varies between brands and models. Some are pretty self-cleaning, others less so. Checking consumer reviews on the usual shopping websites should give you a first idea.</p>

<p>Second, regular cleanup is non-negotiable. If you skip daily cleaning, your machine will become a breeding ground for mold and bacteria. If you doubt that, simply open the machine in an average office where everyone pulls a shot, but nobody bothers to do more than dump out the used grounds every now and then. Especially the brewing part and various pipes can turn you into a tea drinker at a glance.</p>

<p>Of course a two- or three-part setup of grinder, espresso machine and maybe frother must also be cleaned, but apart from the parts touching the milk, you deep-clean far less often (e.g. dismantling the grinder) or a quick rinse or wipe will suffice.</p>

<p>So you have to find your personal threshold for the covenience vs. effort question. The answer will depend on the machine model, but also on the kind of use the machine gets. For our household where we pull between (usually) two and (rarely) eight shots a day and only occasionally steam milk, we purposely picked separate items, but that was also based on counter space and kitchen layout and the charm and flexibility of “handmade” coffee<sup>1</sup>.

<p>Grind size too large is a likely cause. Your coffee simply might not be creating a cohesive barrier to water.

However, I've always wondered if I've been using enough coffee beans as the cup always appears a little watered down.</p>

<p>I've seen plenty of videos and blog posts about how to make an Americano with espresso beans, but i've not found much in terms of making a cup of coffee with non-espresso beans. </p>

<p>I have mine black, no sugar.</p>

<p>The are both ill-defined terms. A better measure is brew ratio, which describes the water to coffee ratio in mass units. On <a href=""https://handground.com/grind/66-recipes-for-amazing-aeropress-coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">handground.com</a>, there are a lot of recipes for AeroPress with brew ratios ranging from 17:1 at the weakest up to 8:1 at the strongest. </p>

<p>I'd suggest starting somewhere in the middle and adjusting based on the results. Since you're already getting a weak cup, the next step should have a slightly lower brew ratio.</p>

<p>You can either switch to mass units (grams or Imperial units with a simple kitchen scale work fine). The benefits of weight units are twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They're more precise. Most kitchen scales are accurate to the gram or even a tenth of a gram. With scoops, you may need to use something like <em>a little bit less than a full scoop</em> and you'll have difficulty reproducing that exactly, even more so when you want to adjust a little bit.</p></li>
<li><p>The units translate to different coffees as well. Suppose you have a coffee with a different roast level, then its density may also vary. As such, a volumetric scoop of one coffee contain more or less coffee than a different variety of coffee. This is more of a factor when working with whole beans, but if you buy pre-ground the grind size will also have an impact when using volumetric scoops.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I'd suggest switching to mass units and keeping track of adjustments and taste. If you don't like to get into the whole ratio thing, you can just fix the water content and increase the amount of coffee to get a stronger cup. The only time when you need to change the amount of water is when you want to adjust how much liquid you get in your final cup.</p>

<p>I haven’t been getting great results with it so far. Also, there seems to be a kind of mismatch between the settings on the machine itself and what I am reading online.</p>

<p>The double basket takes 15 - 18g of coffee, but the double shot button pushes through 60ml of water for a ratio of 1:4 or just under. You can control extraction manually but that seems weird.</p>

<p>From what I’ve read I want 1:2 or just under if I’m making a flat white, so I have been going for 35g of espresso out of 17.5g of coffee in around 26s, not counting pre-infusion.</p>

<p>To get somewhere around those numbers, I have to be on the second finest setting (this is with beans that were roasted in the last 3 weeks) and the needle on the pressure gauge goes beyond the “espresso range” marked.</p>

<p>This all seems pretty bizarre – the shot is nothing out of the ordinary but the settings are at the extremes.</p>

<p>The shots I am getting still taste under-extracted to me. If I go a step finer my extraction time goes way way up, so I also have to reduce the amount of coffee.
Is that the way to go, or should I keep the grind the same and run more water through?</p>

<p>I’m thinking the fact that everything is at the extreme (portafilter packed as full as it will go, grind setting more or less as fine as it will go, pressure out of range) should tell me something, but what? Just that they built the machine around a ratio of around 1:4? I don't understand why they would do that.</p>

<p>I have tried changing the beans btw – it didn’t really make any difference.</p>

<p>I've solved this by adding a wet paper filter before adding the coffee. For this I use paper filters meant for AeroPress, which are only slightly too big for my portafilter (like 2 millimeters too large in diameter). My technique is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Push some water through the filter basket to warm it up a bit, then dry with a paper towel.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a pre-wetted paperfilter to the bottom of the portafilter, press it down with your fingers. It's okay if the sides of the paper filter go up a little bit against the wall of the portafilter.</p></li>
<li><p>Add your ground coffee as you normally do and tamp. Then pull the shot.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For me, this allows me to push a bit more water through compared to keeping everything the same without the paper filter. My theory is that it keeps the holes in the filter basket nice and clear so the water gets pushed through more easily. </p>

<p>Seeing that this is a pretty cheap option, I'd give it a shot.</p>

<p>Therefore, the extraction process considers dissolving the flavors. An uneven roast will affect directly the flavours on the final beverage. Thus, even the perfect extraction will not be able to extract all the flavours it could if the beans weren't correctly roasted.</p>

<p>So what is the final answer as to the proper way to store coffee, specifically whole beans in this case? What are the implications of CO2 build-up in the canister if you open the canister several times per day? Is the CO2 filter on a home coffee canister just a gimmick that only serves a purpose on coffee bags that sit on a shelf sealed for days or weeks on end?</p>

<li><strong>In case the question is relevant to the coffee beverage:</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The well-known recipe for the ground coffee to coffee beverage ratio is around 1:20.</p>

<p>One pound is equivalent of 453.6 grams. Therefore; you may expect to have 9072 grams of brewed beverage. When you assume that a cm<sup>3</sup> coffee beverage is around 1 grams, yo should have a bit more than 9 liters of beverage. Again, this makes around 320 oz. beverage. If you assume that your cups are 10 oz, <strong>you should end up with 32 cups of beverage from 1 pound of ground coffee</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>In case the question is relevant to the density of coffee:</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Updated after Paul's comment)</em></p>

<p>The solution is simpler as it depends solely on the density of coffee. Still, we may require a series of unit conversions.</p>

<p>The density of ground coffee is around 0.32 gr/cm<sup>3</sup>. This means, 453.6 grams (one pound) of coffee has a volume around 1.42 l. This volume is roughly 50 oz. Finally, a cup is 8 to 12 oz, let's say 10 oz on average. Therefore, a pound of coffee should be more or less 5 cups of coffee.</p>

5057,2,,2019-12-30T16:43:13.473,4,,"<p>Based on your comment on the question, you are referring to compacting ground coffee in the portafilter. This process is referred to as <code>tamping</code> when making espresso.</p>

<p>The widely-accepted amount of downward force to use when tamping a standard double shot of espresso is 30 lbs. You can view a <a href=""https://ineedcoffee.com/espresso-tamping/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source here</a> but if you simply do a google search for ""espresso tamping pressure"" you will see 30 lbs mentioned ubiquitously.</p>

<p>If you are using a tamper directly on the coffee grinds, it is easy to practice putting down 30 lbs of force by practicing on a scale. If you are indeed using a <strong>lever</strong> to do the tamping, I suggest reading the instructions that came with your machine.</p>

<p>30 lbs of force on the lever may not result in 30 lbs of force on the espresso, depending on the setup of your machine. The lever may even be engineered specifically to stop tamping at 30 lbs. Tamping espresso with a lever setup can be a bit of controversial thing in the coffee world.</p>

<p><strong>Whatever your setup, you want 30 lbs of downward force to result from whatever it is that contacts with the ground coffee and tamps it down.</strong></p>

<p>Putting too much force on the ground coffee is called over-tamping. The coffee grinds can become over-compacted which can slow down extraction (lead to over-extraction) of the espresso, lead to channeling (where water finds inconsistencies in the grind and channels through in small spots, leading to unequal extraction in the espresso puck), or even block it completely.</p>

<p>If you used 1 ton of downward force when tamping, I suggest that you will likely break your portafilter and its basket, along with whatever is beneath it.</p>

5058,2,,2020-01-02T18:41:47.927,1,,"<p>Looks like an aluminum Moka pot, the only thing that I know that causes that oxidation and or corrosion is washing it in a dishwasher which the acid in dishwasher soap ruined the protective coating on the aluminum allowing it to oxidize.  My Moka pot company said never to use any soap to wash the pot, nor use any harsh cleaning brushes! </p>

<p>Why is that? because aluminium is sort of like cast iron, you have to season cast iron, and an aluminum moka pot has to remain seasoned with coffee oil, and the oil also seals the aluminum to keep the metallic flavor from leaching out into the coffee, that means you should never get the coffee stain out because that's the oil and that oil is necessary to impart richer coffee flavor back into the coffee.  So all you do to clean it every time you use is to simply use cold water and a soft cloth.</p>

<p>Americans don't like the idea of something looking dirty, and the insides of a well used aluminum Moka pot will look nasty after time, but that nastiness is the coffee oil which is good for the coffee flavor.  But if you don't like your Moka pot to look like that then I suggest getting a stainless steel Moka pot, those you can throw in the dishwasher and be done with it, but you will never get that true strong rich Italian moka coffee flavor due to the stainless steel cannot hold onto the oil.  Stainless steel is not the Italian norm, the only reason why stainless steel moka pots are made is because of Americans wanting to keep things clean looking.</p>

<p>If you don't use a aluminum Moka pot every day the oil can go rancid after it sets for awhile then you may have to use hot water and a rag, or even just your thumb to get much of the oil off.  The only thing on a Moka pot that requires washing by hand with soap is the O ring.  If you have to use hot water and a rag or your thumb for cleaning then it's recommended that you run a throw out batch of coffee for it's initial use after such cleaning.</p>

<p>If you buy a new Aluminum Moka Pot you need to run 3 things of coffee through it and dump it each time to help the oil to seal and season the Moka pot before drinking coffee from it the first time. </p>

<p>Also keep on hand a couple of O rings, because once the O ring goes bad so does the coffee!</p>

The Stanford Sleepiness Scale  was used to asses the decrease in somnolence induced by caffeine pre-consumption, post 10 min, post 20 min, and post 30 min. Scores for ""subjective activation"" were also recorded at the same intervals. </p>

<p>Many previous studies assessed the effects of larger than normal amounts of caffeine 30-40 min after consumption whereas this study focused on the appearance of early responses in the subjective state associated to caffeine at typical doses between 100-250 mg. </p>

<p>According to the study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The appearance of such effect in our study was very quick, at 10 min after caffeine intake, and then it progressively increased at 20 min and showed the highest effect at 30 min post-administration. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also mention that the results were similar to other studies conducted in 1998 and 2000 which state that the levels of caffeine may already be 50% of Tₘₐₓ within 10 min post-consumption, reaching a maximum plasma concentration (Tₘₐₓ) around 30-40 min after oral administration.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the effects were documented or <em>recorded</em> at 10 min post consumption (50% Tₘₐₓ), meaning that the initial effects can be felt <em>at least</em> 10 min after drinking coffee but maybe sooner at 20%. Caffeine is one of those drugs that your body quickly adjusts to which is why the effects wear off when the blood concentration falls to 50% roughly 5 hours after consumption but when you reach an initial concentration of 50% or less, it can be noticeably felt.</p>

<p>So, if it takes you 10 min to drink a cup of coffee, you may begin to feel the effects as soon as you are finished with your first cup. The full effect (at least 75% Tₘₐₓ) may be felt after an additional 10-25 min.  </p>

""Italian coffee"" is likely either espresso ground to be used with an espresso machine or literally ""imported from Italy"".</p>

<p>Turkish coffee is for use with a special, Turkish brewing process. The coffee dust is mixed with water in a special pot called a cezve or an ibrik. The solution is brought to a boil. Then the coffee is scooped or poured from the pot. Turkish coffee is drunk unfiltered, so you drink the actual coffee like you would with cocoa.</p>

<p>Espresso is brewed by forcing water through coffee grounds at pressure. The pressure extracts oils and compounds from the coffee to create the famous Italian coffee called espresso. The grounds have to be relatively course compared to Turkish to support this process; too fine grinds in an espresso machine would clog the machine. Espresso is partially filtered, meaning you don't drink most of the actual coffee grounds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a chemical substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As caffeine, which coffee contains, is an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"" rel=""noreferrer"">active ingredient</a> in some medicines (such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadin"" rel=""noreferrer"">Anadin</a>) it certainly fits that definition so it would be correct to say that coffee contains a drug (putting aside decaf). If you take the first sentence of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia page</a> that describes <em>drug</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A drug (/drɑːɡ/) is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Caffeine also fits that definition as there's a body of evidence that supports that description when talking about caffeine.</p>

<p><strong>Would you give coffee to your dog?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely not. There is a page on petmd.com titled <a href=""https://www.petmd.com/dog/emergency/poisoning-toxicity/caffeine-and-pets-safety-tips-and-considerations"" rel=""noreferrer"">Caffeine and Pets: Safety Tips and Considerations</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It turns out our pets react in much the same way we do. Caffeine makes them restless. They get jittery and their hearts start to race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn't sound.... ideal! It turns out that it's not, and the next part of the page makes it pretty clear why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But because our pets weigh so much less than we do, it only takes a relatively small amount of caffeine to cause a big problem, potentially leading to expensive hospitalization or even death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further on in the article it's explained that 23-27mg caffeine per lb of body weight can lead to cardio-toxicity. For a 3.5kg cat, such as mine, that equates to between 177mg and 207mg of caffeine. Based on the table in <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/a/1538/1587"">this answer</a>, that puts a double espresso or a 200mg caffeine tablet squarely in that range.</p>

<p>That's absolutely not to say that giving your dog, or other pet, coffee (even decaf!) is something you should consider doing. The petmd page states it much better than I ever could (my emphasis):</p>

<p>I've looked it up and it seems that different pods (even within the same brand) are designed for different water volumes passing through them and at different temperatures, so if there are multiple recommended ways to brew them DIY-style, I'd like to know which method fits which the best.

<p>I think what you mean is that the coffee in question tastes too clean or too dry. That can be caused by using filtered water with too low dissolved solids or water with too high sodium content. The best water to use for brewing is generally thought to be hard water rich in magnesium and calcium, with no chlorine and low sodium content. If the dry, flat taste of coffee bothers you, try using mineral water, or, if you really want to experiment, buy water additive made specifically for making brewing water like Third Wave (you can find it on Amazon). You mix this additive with distilled water to create mineral water. You can also make your own water additive with 0.75g epsom salt and 0.36g baking soda per gallon of distilled water.</p>

<p>Water quality is very likely the problem if coffee consistently tastes flat, dry, or ""clean"". The only way to test this is to try the same brew with different water.</p>

<p>To get microfoam, you only have to produce a little foam at the start of steaming, a few light 'rips' of bubbles, then the rest of the time is spent whirling this into the milk. Keep the wand tip just below the milk and a little to the side while keeping the pitcher flat. This will create a whirlpool that helps mix everything else up. Hope this helps.</p>

Every coffee roaster tastes their coffee with a certain water, and it's likely the coffee tastes best with the water it was roasted against. You might experience the opposite problem from what you described with some roasts.</p>

<p>There are multiple things you'll want to account for. There are many undesirable flavors you can get from heavy metals, or chlorine-tasting water (so at a minimum you want your water to taste good). Beyond that, you really care about the amount of Calcium, Magnesium, and buffer (generally HCO3) in your water. </p>

<p>Based on what you said of your water, I suspect you have quite a bit more bi-carbonate hardness (HCO3 or buffer) in your water. This kind of hardness will rip out the acids in the coffee very well, but will also push the pH level of the final cup to a balanced state. Your friend's water likely lacks enough to bring the coffee's pH to a balanced state where it's enjoyable (fun hack, add ~2g/L of baking soda to water, a source of bi-carbonate, and add this in increments to the final coffee, you can fix the acidity!)</p>

<p>Calcium and Magnesium also work together to bring out acids and other taste-y bits to your coffee. Calcium + Bi-carbonate is why your kettle is scaling quickly. You can filter your water (a cheap Brita filter will remove Ca and Mg from your water). </p>

<p>I personally mix my water up from distilled for brewing to a specific ppm of Ca, Mg, and Bi-carbonate. </p>

<p>You can increase your total hardness of water if you get a better system by simply adding baking soda to the water, or other mineral salts. I would be careful about this however and ensure you are still creating something that is safe to drink. </p>

<p>If you want measure your water, you can use various titration kits to quantify your house water. If you want to do more research on water and coffee, <a href=""https://eustore.sca.coffee/products/book-water-for-coffee?_pos=15&amp;_sid=a35b576e2&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=5081224388"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> is the popular book on it.

<p>Coffee generally does like this: it tastes generally like coffee. Differences between blends are typically minor and nuanced things that can't be described well with words. There are notable exceptions, but still, the differences are hard to describe.</p>

Grinding finer exposes more surface area of the bean to the brew and helps you eke out a bit more flavor when the bean is old and stale.</p>

<p>However, doing this for pour over can backfire as pour over is highly sensitive to grind. Too fine and your pour over won't drain; the filter will clog.</p>

<p>Try it first with your normal grind, and if that's no good, dial it one or two clicks finer. Much past that and you're in no go territory for the brew method most likely.</p>

<li>Made in espresso machine.</li>
<li>Ground to order.</li>
<li>Run through several times as I ""overpacked"" the coffee. </li>
<li>Hot water added to make Americano. </li>
<li>Beans from local roaster, last week.</li>

I have tried all kinds of coffee making process, Moka pot coffee, espresso machines, drip coffee, French press. As well as trying various professional barista type establishments.</p>

<p>I quite accidentally discovered coffee pad machines, such as the one made by Senseo:

<p>My question is: Why?
I am curious as to the chemical and physical processes that make coffee prepared in this way so smooth. I realise this is of course subjective. My own pallet comes into play, the type of coffee pads I use and so on.</p>

<p>Another question: Is this a ""true"" espresso?
It seems unlikely to me that these types of machine can produce the types of pressure seen in the more traditional espresso machines. It produces a crema, but I suspect that this is artificial from aeration, similar to how some of the cheaper espresso basket systems have an actual aerator in the basket to produce the appearance of a crema.  </p>

<p>Has anyone had a similar reaction to this type of coffee preparation method? I find it some what ironic that with all the science that goes into coffee preparation -- especially in the context of espresso -- that this simple thing -- for me -- makes the best cup of coffee</p>

<p>This dilutes your coffee a little bit, and suppresses any sour or overly bitter notes. Personally I like it even better than coffee without it because you get the softer coffee flavours that might usually be over powered in a standard coffee.</p>

<p>I would also ask why the caffeine is important to you? Regular consumption doesn't improve one's concentration as the body normalises to it.  </p>

<h2><strong>However</strong></h2>

<p>I would consult your doctor and seek their advice. Acid reflux can be just a mild irritation and easily managed but it can lead to more complicated issues -- such as Barrett's oesophagus. If you are that sensitive to caffeine you might want to leave it alone, or, restrict yourself to decaffeinated drinks. </p>

<p>The link will educate you as to the particulars of the Lungo. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both lungos and Americanos are made using an espresso machine and
  water. Which makes you ask ‘Is a lungo an Americano?’. The method of
  making both these coffees sounds the same, but there is a big
  difference. When you make a lungo, all of the water is brewed and it
  generally comes out shorter than an Americano.</p>
  
  <p>When you make an Americano you add the water after the espresso has
  been pulled from the espresso machine. Americanos also usually come in
  larger cups so you can add as much water as you like to the coffee.</p>
  
  <p>Lungos should be served in a slightly smaller cup because you don’t
  need to add any water after making it. But if you really like, no one
  will probably judge you if you do!</p>
  
  <p>Both coffees are made with ground coffee and roughly the same amount
  of water. So you’d expect them to taste the same right? Wrong. Adding
  the water after the espresso has been pulled gives you a weaker
  flavored coffee. Having the water pass through the ground coffee
  granules, as they do in a Lungo, gives you a much stronger flavored
  coffee. Great for those of you who like a strong dark coffee to kick
  start your day!</p>

So what was going to the charity shop is now giving good service and good coffee. I hope that this has been a help to anyone who has problems with their coffee pot. Trust me its worth having a go.

This is something I've experienced with pour-over brews. I've used my Fellow Stagg [X] Dripper before, and at 15g of coffee it's perfect, however at 24g the weight of the coffee is too great and it presses the filter and coffee directly against the holes on the bottom of the dripper.</p>

<p>Throughout the process I'll give the coffee a few stirs with a stir-stick, and it will immediately start flowing faster. It makes sense that you'd get a sweeter more balanced cup when the coffee doesn't choke. To me it also makes sense that you have a greater chance of it choking with more beans. Not sure how it could un-choke by itself, one theory is that once enough water pressure is present it creates a low-resistance channel where water flows through very quickly (and this water doesn't extract much coffee, rather would mostly dilute in this case).</p>

5191,2,,2020-04-30T15:24:25.087,2,,"<p>This is a catchy question. :)</p>

<p>By tradition, all pumps have a pressure gauge at the end. So, tradition it is.</p>

<p>If you wonder why it is a common place to put a pressure gauge; the reason is if you don't monitor and control the pressure at the pump end the results could be catastrophic. Imagine that something blocks the output of the pump and you didn't monitor it. The pump will try to push the block with all its might. So, the pressure will rise up to the maximum and very probably, the whole set up will blow up.</p>

<p>Then, you see that there is a pressure release valve on the chart (Looks like a simplified P&amp;ID). When the gauge reads above normal, this valve protects the device from excess pressure by releasing out the steam to the atmosphere. So, now we have a safe pump.</p>

<p>Finally, why the pressure gauge is not connected to the boiler? Actually, if you check the P&amp;ID, you see a straight line from the pump end to the boiler top. No valve exists there. So, the pressure at the pump end and boiler top are equal as they all share the same volume.</p>

<p>You are right that the boiler has a warming chamber and its pressure may be different than the boiler top. I think, as there are not valves exist in between the boiler top, warming chamber and the boiler bottom, the designers think that the steady state pressure will be even among these three volumes. Even though the pressure at the warming chamber could be a bit above than the other parts, this should be temporary and the warming chamber is made from a though material.</p>

<p>I would like to mention one more thing. The flow goes from higher pressure to lower pressure. Saying in reverse, to make the steam flow, the pressure at the pump end should be slightly higher than the boiler top. So, the gauge should deviate slightly from its steady position temporarily when the pump is in action. You may try to observe this to validate my reasoning.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Sorry, I mentioned that the pressure release valve releases some steam to the atmosphere. I assume, the reservoir has atmosphere pressure. The released steam will probably get mixed with the liquid water in the reservoir.</p>

5192,2,,2020-04-30T20:07:21.037,-1,,"<p>this may be a feature, not a flaw. some coffee makers these days hold the water until sufficient pressure builds to allow the coffee to brew before draining (some call this ""dwelltime"" afaik). just a thought; no idea how your particular maker works.</p>

<p>moreover, it's common when making coffee by hand to pre-infuse your grinds with water to allow the CO2 in the beans to off-gas. this is done by wetting the grinds just enough for them to get wet, without actually draining through to the urn. your maker might have a pre-infusion system built in as well. some fancier espresso machines a have automatic pre-infusion presets.</p>

<p>if it's neither of these, it could be the coffee naturally blooming in the filter. especially fresh coffee takes on a lot of water before it starts to brew, which would create a hysteresis effect, but probably not as noticeable as you're describing.</p>

<p>edit: sorry i misread your post and see now that the slow-down happens 3/4ths of the way through. i'm afraid my answers don't account for that but i'll leave it up in case anyone happens to find it useful/interesting. to me this sounds more like a clog that gets pushed through when enough water pressure builds up.</p>

And using good coffee, and experimenting with technique, I have produced some very rich, nicely-balanced extractions. However, I have been able to reduce, but never fully remove, some underlying burnt notes in the coffee produced. This problem has led me to ask myself about the nature of the moka pot design itself.</p>

<p>Water in the chamber is heated and the vapour inside trapped. Once the vapour pressure in the chamber is great enough, it forces the heated water up the spout, through the coffee charge, and into the collection chamber. My experience has led me to ask: is the heat required to produce adequate vapour pressure is not inherently higher than the ideal, hence predisposing the moka pot to producing bitter or burnt coffee?</p>

<p>This also raises questions about best practice in moka pot coffee extraction. It would suggest that the best extraction would be when ambient air pressure is lower, the coffee charge is not tamped, the water is heated gradually, and the water is not fully consumed (i.e. the extraction is terminated before the water in the chamber is gone).</p>

<p>My own experimentation would tend to confirm the notion of <em>not</em> tamping the charge, but I have had limited success associating technique with outcomes.</p>

<p>Have any objective measurements been made with regard to the temperature and pressure inside a moka pot, with the charge tamped or untamped? And how do those measurements compare with the theoretical ideals for coffee extraction?</p>

5199,2,,2020-05-04T14:13:02.087,3,,"<p>This is nothing I've tried myself, but to add onto your theory of the heat required to brew the Moka-Pot, I believe we'll arrive at an answer. The problem is not likely the water temperature itself, it turns out it's realistically pretty difficult to get boiling water onto coffee when using some sort of brew method (as the metal absorbs enough heat to drop the water temp). </p>

<p>However the lengthy heat time on the mokapot will actually heat up the ground coffee itself during brew, and this can lead to poor tasting coffee. The best thing you can do, from my understanding is pre-heat the mokapot bottom and start with hot water before assembling and putting on the stove. Additionally, as soon as the coffee starts spurting, it's done and you can run under cool water to halt brewing as well.</p>

<p>Low and slow is the name of the game with the moka pot. You want just enough heat for steam to push through the coffee and not a bit more. Too much heat will burn grinds and will eject coffee up the spout and into your brew. You do not want a boil, so heat shouldn't be the problem.</p>

<p>However, how much heat is required to produce sufficient steam will depend on how much coffee you're using and your grind. Experiment with these variables (don't tamp!) to work out good values for your preferences and pot size.</p>

<li><p>The Brikka has a safety valve  integrated in the base which should prevent blowing up. However, the coffee will likely be burnt if the steam comes out of the side for a long time. You can try using a lond spoon/knife to lift the weight manually to not waste the coffee.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally I would advise against tamping the coffee at all. The amount of pressure it needs to lift the weight and the point where the safety valve opens isn't too far apart. If you tamp, the water needs to exert pressure against the coffee and the weight which is often too much or takes too long.
The key is to find the correct grind size. Start with too coarse, fill the basket, remove excess from top and don't tamp. The coffee should extract quickly with a sigle ""swoosh"" but taste and crema will be on the light side.
Now start reducing the grind size until you hear a bit of a strain in the ""swoosh"" and it will take a bit longer. This is the point you are aiming for. Since the Brikka does preinfusion, the swelling grounds will provide enough resistance to get the oils out and thus the crema. If the safety valve opens, it was too fine.</p></li>
<li><p>The most important measure of coffee is taste, so I'd suggest try to get the taste right before worrying about how the crema looks which is very dependent on the beans, their age, the roast. (dark roasts with lots of robusta if you want crema) Keep in mind that not all roasts are equally suited for the brikka and that due to the lower pressure you won't get the same kind of crema a portafilter machine will make.</p></li>

<p>I think in last December, I made coffee and forget to remove the old coffee from the funnel and noticed it after one week. I cleaned it immediately with detergent and even rubbed it with a dishwashing brush... Then I made coffee again and it smelled horrible, like I wasn't able to remove all the leftover coffee. I noticed that some coffee was actually in the filter and I put one of the hairs of the brush inside every hole to get rid of the old coffee residues. Some of them were attached to each other with mold. It was a terrible experience to clean it, it took more than one hour. Then I brewed 2-3 times and throw away the coffee I made, just to make sure everything is actually cleaned. </p>

<p>I also noticed these spots at this incident. I am not sure if they were there before. I did some research on how to get rid of these spots and realised I shouldn't be cleaning the pot with soap... I don't use soap anymore. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/afYIT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/afYIT.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I don't know what these spots are. I couldn't get rid of them and I thought maybe it is just oxidation. I still use the pot and coffee tastes normal, as it should be, but rarely I still get the smell.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get rid of these spots? How can I make sure that they are really oxidation? Should I keep using it?</p>

<p>As for the smell, the filter basket has a layer with holes in it, the underside of which is very hard to clean as you have to get to through the funnel.</p>

<p>However, I suspect the top part. There is a filter and a rubber seal. Remove the seal and clean the ""hidden"" part of the top filter as well as the the area all the way up. The rubber seal is very likely to have picked up a bad odour. This happens quite often when the moka pot  was too hot and burned the seal, making subsequent cups taste (and smell) like burnt rubber. These rubber seals are cheaply available as a replacement part.</p>

5243,2,,2020-06-03T08:41:14.283,2,,"<p>Your problem falls into two categories. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The bottom part with the suspicious spots.<br>
I think this is just another example of oxidation as mentioned <a href=""https://parenting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1400/11249https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/3379/moka-pot-oxidization-rust-or-mold"">here</a> and <a href=""https://coffee.stackexchange.com/questions/2069/what-are-these-spots-on-the-inside-of-my-moka-pot-do-i-need-to-remove-them"">here</a>. Follow the instructions in the linked Q/As to remove them. In the unlikely case of them being mold (unlikely, because the mold wouldn't have anything to cling to or feed on), scrubbing should take care of them as well.</p></li>
<li><p>The mold colony in the funnel and the resulting smell.<br>
The funnel part of a Moka has a very specific setup, the part below the perforated bottom of the grounds container is very hard to reach. This is where you dug out your lumps of mold from before. See this <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> image to understand where exactly the problem sits - literally:<br>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fllCR.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fllCR.png"" alt=""Moka pot cross section""></a> -> see part B, under the dotted line.<br>
If you have the kind of mold buildup you described, poking through the holes from the top will not remove all residue, you need to find a way to access the part from below, though the funnel, making sure to reach all the way to the edges with a suitable tool. A sturdy pipe cleaner comes to mind, for example. If you don't manage to remove the mold residue, there's a good chance that you will not get rid of the smell and even if you sterilized the existing material via boiling, it may still a) impact proper water flow during brewing and b) be a breeding ground for future buildup. Of course we can't judge the amount of mold via the internet, so use common sense. Be careful with chemicals, the aluminum is not well-suited to corrosive cleaners.<br>
There's probably a <em>second</em> mold colony under the top sieve, the part held in place by the rubber gasket (upper dotted line in the image above). This is much easier to remove and clean, although you will want to get up the coffee channel as well. As it's nearly impossible to remove mold from the gasket, I recommend you replace the gasket - you want a few spare gaskets anyway, as they need to be replaced every now and then.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>After a thorough cleaning and scrubbing, run the Moka a few times with water only, until you get a smell-free brew. Then you can start again with coffee, treating the Moka as if it was a new pot. (Some users insist on discarding the first few batches to build up the patina first, claiming either taste or health reasons.)</p>

5245,2,,2020-06-05T07:16:24.847,1,,"<p>A bubble tea (or in this case, coffee) drink consists of roughly these parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>a liquid (in this case, coffee or espresso)</li>
<li>sugar and / or a flavoring ingredient  </li>
<li>tapioca pearls</li>
<li>ice to dilute and chill it</li>
</ul>

<p>In your case, the use of sweetened condensed milk make it <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_iced_coffee"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">“Vietnamese coffee”</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to get some additional flavor into the drink, use the coffee shop staple <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavored_syrup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flavor syrup</a> - the same product that is used to flavor other espresso-based drinks.

If you are so inclined, a websearch will also lead to lots of home-made recipes, especially for flavors like caramel or vanilla.</p>

<p>So how would a substitution work?<br>
In short, you can either </p>

<ul>
<li>use the syrup in addition to the sweetened condensed milk (will be extra sweet as you have two sugar sources)</li>
<li>use it instead of the sweetened condensed milk (if you are not interested in the milky component) </li>
<li>use it with unsweetened milk, condensed or regular, or coffee cream for the creamier mouthfeel.</li>

<p>I grew up in Yorkshire with some of the softest water in the country [which is precisely why in older times it was the centre of the woollen industry - things wash better in soft water, using half the soap], but spent the past 30 years in London. Until I moved here I thought water filters like <a href=""https://www.brita.co.uk/water-filter-system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brita</a>* were just some affectation for rich people. They're not, they're to stop London water tasting so bad, get rid of the weird scum on your cuppa &amp; prevent your kettle looking like Mother Shipton's cave after two weeks ;)</p>

<p>With a jug filter, I need to descale my kettle every year or so &amp; my coffee machine never, as it has its own similar filtration built-in.</p>
<p>Bottled water has too many variables. It doesn't quickly indicate hardness, you have to read the small print &amp; extract the relevant information. It's also ridiculously expensive compared to filtration.   Drinking bottled water comes from the days before all domestic water was potable &amp; remains only as the above-mentioned affectation.   There's nothing vaguely 'unhygienic' about any British water [nor the entire EU for that matter].</p>

Starting from the third pour, the water was taking too long to go through the filter, making the total brewing time of my cup (300ml) was around 7 minutes, while I was trying to replicate the 4:6 method by Tetsu Kasuya, which takes around 3 minutes and a half.

5272,1,,2020-07-01T15:14:09.360,2,116,"<p>I've never been able to figure out all the patterns to be able to understand which coffee gives me more of the positive effects - mental and physical energy, good mood; with less of the negative effects - anxiety, shakes, tiredness, angriness. So I'm looking for advice on what are likely to be the main factors and how I can make the best <strong>feeling</strong> cup of coffee at home.</p>
<p>Anecdotally a great expensive coffee from a good coffee shop makes me feel good. I generally have a flat white with a little sugar. At the other end of the scale cheap coffee from the supermarket prepared strong in a mocha and drunk straight up can make me feel terrible - easy to anger, anxious, shaky. Starbucks coffee makes me feel physically terrible, and I haven't drunk it for ages. The last time I did I had to sit down as I was nauseus and overcome with tiredness.</p>
<p>I have never found anything that lets me make a great feeling cup of coffee at home. My best feeling cup at the moment is espresso from a mocha, long, with cream and sugar.</p>
<p>It seems like at different times the main factors have been:</p>
<ul>
<li>The coffee bean</li>
<li>The roast (dark roast = more anxious)</li>
<li>How it's prepared</li>
<li>How I consume it (with/without milk, long/short, with/without sugar)</li>
<li>Freshness of bean</li>
<li>Freshness of the coffee</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course I can't rule out my personal mental and physical health at the time, although caffeine does affect me quite strongly so I tend not to drink it when I'm already feeling anxious.</p>
<p>So, what are the main factors in how a cup of coffee feels? Is it just personal or is there a way I can optimise for the positive effects? I'm prepared to spend a bit more on the coffee if it feels good. I have various mochas to make espresso, drippers and French press.</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p>The chance that the filter holder and the cup rim fit so perfectly for an instant lock is slim, but you shouldn’t underestimate the power to a bit of condensation when it comes to creating a seal. I had a similar problem just the other week when bottling hot syrup with a funnel without ridges: The first one or two were fine, after that, I got that splashing whenever the water film tore for a moment and ultimately had to lift the funnel ever so slightly over the bottle rim to ensure a steady flow. I have had issues with airlock when using a porcelain Melitta filter holder, so I can totally confirm that some types of filter holders do tend to seal.</p>
<p>Even one of your plastic pieces should already be enough to prevent the issue.</p>

<p>Coffee itself isn't inherently bad for you. Some science suggests its good for you in fact.  The problem is in how we choose to prepare it for drinking.</p>
<p>Sugar and cream... both up for debate I think. Sugar is an essential component to life. Milk isn't bad for you either, necessarily.  Like anything else though, moderation is key.  Milk does contain fats and sugars.  So if you're watching your intake of these things for health sake, then milk contributes its own parts.

<p>The coffee will not taste good, it's been standing around for way too long. If you tried to brew it, it would taste like cardboard, wood and maybe ash. Roasted coffee tastes best a few days and up to a few weeks after roasting, then the taste starts degrading.</p>
<h3>Health Concerns</h3>
<p>There might actually be some mold and bacteria in those coffee bags if they haven't been vacuum sealed.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If it's green coffee and you have a roaster go ahead and roast them. They will probably still taste cardboard-y but with temperatures of above 200°C during roasting you won't have to worry about bacteria. If it's roasted coffee, I'd just throw it away. If you're really emotionally attached to it, you might try to brew it once and taste a little. The chances of you dying or having severe reactions to it is fairly low if you don't drink it in large quantities.</p>

5303,2,,2020-08-09T13:12:05.390,0,,"<p>Short answer: No</p>
<p>Slightly longer answer: The temperature, pressure and method of brewing barely impact the amount of caffeine extracted from the bean.</p>
<p>Because caffeine dissolves so readily in hot water, the single most important factor in determining the amount of caffeine in the cup is the amount of coffee used to prepare said cup. Arabica beans contain about 0.8-1.4% of caffeine by weight, depending on the variety. So if you were to brew an espresso (15g in 30g out) or a pour over (15g in 250g out), you would have the same amount of caffeine in each beverage.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Mince the roots into equal particles with a knife. The roots are sturdy, so you’ll need a sharp knife, especially since the pieces shouldn’t be longer than 1 inch. If you don’t cut them in the same size, there’s a chance that they will not roast evenly.</li>
<li>Roast the chicory pieces. Arrange them on a shallow baking pan or a baking sheet and place them into the oven. Toast them at 350 degrees until their color changes to golden brown. If you can sense a coffee-like smell, this means they are finished.</li>
<li>Grind the roots. Place the roasted chicory roots into your burr grinder and grind them with the same coarseness as you grind your coffee beans. Ideally, it should be a fine grind if you’ll brew them in an espresso machine or a coarser grind if you have a French press, etc.</li>
<li>Mix chicory with ground coffee. The ratio is up to you. If you want the taste of coffee without the caffeine stimulation, you can try with a 4:1 ratio of chicory to coffee. Sometimes a 2:3 chicory-to-coffee blend of is good if you want to gradually reduce your caffeine intake. If you want to spread out your coffee supply over a longer period, adding four-fifths of chicory would be enough. Alternatively, you don’t have to add coffee at all for a true chicory coffee.</li>
<li>Grind the roots. Place the roasted chicory roots into your burr grinder and grind them wit.</li>
<li>Brew your coffee. Use the chicory and coffee powder mix to make the coffee as you regularly would. All the other factors such as time or technique should be the same.</li>
<li>Add some foamed milk, toppings, or flavorings to enhance the aroma and serve your chicory root coffee.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically you roast the chicory in the oven at 350°F (or 177°C) until they turn brown and after cooling them you mix 20-40% of their grounds with coffee grounds. Mixing chicory in doesn't really yield gourmet coffee so imprecise recipes are to be expected.</p>

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decaffeination#Supercritical_CO2_process"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supercritical CO2 process</a> was used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Food scientists have also turned to supercritical carbon dioxide as a means of decaffeination. Developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Planck Institute, it uses CO2, heated and pressurised above its critical point, to extract caffeine. In this process, green coffee beans are steamed and then added to a high pressure vessel. A mixture of water and carbon dioxide (CO2) is circulated through the vessel at 300 atm and 65 ºC (150°F). At this temperature and pressure CO2 is a supercritical fluid, with properties midway between a gas and a liquid. Caffeine dissolves into the CO2; compounds contributing to the flavour of the brewed coffee are largely insoluble in CO2 and remain in the bean. In a separate vessel, caffeine is scrubbed from the CO2 with additional water. The CO2 is then recirculated to the pressure vessel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was supposed to taste of malt, molasses, nuts and chocolate but when I opened the bag, the coffee smelled like petrol, and pretty agressively so. It smelled a little like caramel but the smell of petrol was just overwhelming. While brewing, especially during the bloom, the grounds smelled of tobacco. The coffee was pretty sour, tasted of tobacco, tar, and petrol. I tried adjusting the grind size but to no avail. I also tried waiting a week, two weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks - the coffee smelled and tasted exactly the same.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind these beans were by no means roasted dark, it was a medium roast, definitely not roasted much beyond the first crack.</p>
<p>Are these tastes considered defects? How do these tastes end up in the coffee? Were the green beans bad, did it happen during the decaffeination or did the roasters screw up?</p>
<p>I have had many decaffeinated coffees so far but none tasted of tobacco and petrol - many just tasted like sour chocolate and a little hollow.</p>

I tried looking for new ones, but as it often happens with coffee machines, the spare parts end up costing almost the same as the coffee machine.</p>
<p>I found some options on ebay, but the average price went around 60-70 USD for the filter holder, and for a machine that cost me about 250 USD, I am not sure if it's worth it.</p>
<p>Is it feasible to stick the flow divider with silicone or some kind of glue? I mean the filter has some clipping mechanisms, but I think they no longer hold, so would a permanent glue / fixing work for this? Is there some health risk related to the glue / silicone and the coffee? I mean the flow divider has small tubes that exit the whole metal structure and where the ejector button is, there's a small rubber isolation.</p>

Adding milk can affect the time in which your body absorbs caffeine, it is extended, but you won't probably feel this.
In 1997, scientists discovered that your nervous system won't be as stimulated (compared to drinking dark coffee) when you'll drink coffee with milk, but there won't be much of a difference in the concentration of caffeine in your blood.
There's no confirmation that milk reacts with caffeine and affects it in any way, but there's a thing with which milk does interact. It's called CGA, chlorogenic acid, a highly active polyphenol with glycolytic and insulin-sensitizing properties and, of course, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
Adding milk to coffee can lower the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid and other polyphenols by binding them to milk proteins, especially beta-lactoglobulin.
You won't feel the difference so much, you'd have to look at numbers on your blood test to tell that there's something different apart from the taste of the coffee.
Nothing's gonna be a problem unless you don't have moderation on how much you drink it.</p>

<p><strong>Detail:</strong> The panarello brings in extra air to make the frothing and steaming of the milk a much more consistent, reliable process. Unfortunately, from a latte perspective, the bubbles end up being too big and are more suited to frothy cappuccino.</p>
<p>I have had this machine for two years and had given up on any chance of proper latte art. Then, in searching for supporting evidence before answering you, I found <a href=""https://coffeeblog.co.uk/delonghi-magnifica-esam-4200-review/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Magnifica review</a> where the reviewer says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The popular option with domestic Espresso machines are panarello
wands, a sheath which covers the steam pipe and introduces steam to
the milk via holes on the side. ... They produce only large bubbled
froth, to be spooned into cappuccino – which is fine if that’s what
you like.</p>
<p>If, however, you’re wanting to produce lovely, shiny microfoam, with
much smaller bubbles, for making delicious velvety flat whites,
cortado/piccolo, macchiato, latte or cappuccino, and to have a go at
pouring latte art, then panarello isn’t going to work for you.</p>
<p><strong>De’Longhi have recognized this, and they have made it very easy to
simply pull off the panarello to reveal the plastic steam pipe, which
is essentially a single hole steam tip steam wand</strong>, or at least works
in a similar fashion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In truth, it's doubtful that this was actually De'Longhi's intention. Without the outer panarello screwed in, the steam tip is held in place only by friction and - at least once it has been removed and replaced a few times - will frequently pop out from the pressure of the steam. Trying to hold it in place with your thumb or finger is tricky, risks burning your hand and (most importantly!) distracts you from keeping the milk jug in the right place.</p>
<p>I've tried it a few times and the results have been mixed. Microfoam is certainly more achievable, but so is completely flat, textureless milk! However, there's enough potential there that I'm going to spend a small amount of money on a new panarello and then cut it shorter with a saw so that it can hold the tip in place without adding unnecessary extra air to the milk.</p>
<p><em><strong>Edit</strong></em>: Rather than cutting anything, you could also put your finger over the little dimple through which air is added. Still be careful of touching the hot chrome arm.</p>

Here is an excerpt from the manual.</p>
<p>• Empty and clean the coffee grounds drawer daily, with the machine turned on.
• After having removed the coffee grounds drawer, remove the liquids from the tray placed under the brew group.</p>
<p>Note: We recommend emptying the container if the machine is not going to be used for some days.</p>
<p>After brewing milk beverages, dispense hot water from the steam wand (Pannarello, if supplied) to obtain a thorough cleaning.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every day, after heating the milk, remove the external part of the Pannarello (if supplied) and wash it with fresh drinking water.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clean the steam wand weekly. To do this, the following operations have to
be performed:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove the external part of the Pannarello (for standard cleaning);</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove the upper part of the Pannarello from the steam wand;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wash the upper part of the Pannarello with fresh drinking water;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wash the steam wand with a wet cloth and remove any milk residues;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Replace the upper part in the steam wand (make sure it is completely inserted).
Reassemble the external part of the Pannarello.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is recommended to clean the water tank daily. For an easier removal of the
water tank, move the steam wand / Pannarello upwards:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Remove the small white filter in the water tank and wash it under running drinking water.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reposition the small white filter in its housing by gently pressing and turning it at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fill the tank with fresh drinking water.</p>

5343,1,,2020-09-04T19:47:28.093,1,31,"<p>I'm an occasional avid coffee drinker. That is, I don't drink much (at most 1 cup a day, sometimes a few days with 0 cups) but when I do I want it to be (really) good.</p>
<p>I just want a good cup of regular coffee, and possibly a latte every now and then. I don't care too much for an espresso.</p>
<p>Up until now I've used the freeze dried stuff and sometimes one of those glass wait-and-then-press things. Both of them with mediocre results that leaves me wanting (most likely because I'm in a hurry and don't do it properly).</p>
<p>So, I want to get better coffee, without breaking the bank and without needing to count seconds or measure precise amounts of anything (both are things I suck at early in the morning). To me the capsule coffee makers seem like the perfect solution. But which one should I get?</p>
<p>There are so many of them. Went to a Nespresso store today and they let me taste a coffee from Nespresso Vertuo Next which in all honestly was good (better than what I usually drink) although I kind of expected even better, and when I read reviews about it they were.. mixed (things like the first cup being cold). So I'm back to square one and not knowing what I need.</p>
<p>Maybe you guys have some tips? I'm hoping to stay within or under 230 USD.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1.</strong> Was asked to define a (to me) good cup of coffee. This is hard and I doubt I know the correct terms for what you are asking me to describe.. But I'll give it a stab. I like a well rounded cup, that's not too bitter (I usually stay away from the really dark roast) but I also want a distinct strong coffee taste (not watered down). In my opinion, a good cup of coffee does not need milk or sugar (although I do add milk sometimes, and I do enjoy a latte every now and then). I also want a good crema on the cup. Oh, and it needs to be hot. I hate cold coffee, I want it above 90 degrees celcius.</p>
<p>On a vacation to Teneriffa a few years ago I realized that every single little mom and pop shop had this machine (or very similar) and were all extremely good at making a good cup of joe. I have since then not tasted as good coffee as I had during that week again. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back just for the damn coffee.

<p>My machine (Ascaso Dream PID) came with 14 gram portafilter basket (58mm in diameter). Several sources have told me that I really should dose according to the dose label on my basket - no more than +/- 1 gram. I have tried to brew with 14 grams of coffee, but have failed miserably:</p>
<ul>
<li>My shots always run too fast and the taste is pretty light and sour (underextracted?).</li>
<li>I have pushed my grinder (Baratza Sette 270Wi) to the smallest possible grind-size, but it's still too fast. Though at these smallest sizes it's getting pretty tricky to keep the water running evenly through the pack. Again, various sources have told me that I shouldn't go too fine with my grind. The manual of my grinder suggests starting with grind setting 7E for espresso. At that setting with 14 grams of coffee I'm getting a 30g shot in 16 seconds.</li>
<li>I have experimented with various ways of getting my tamping as consistent and level as possible. My current tamping process as follows: knock the portafilter several times against table to level off the initial pile of grains, spin the leveling tool, press down firmly with tamper.</li>
<li>I have fiddled a bit around with pressure. Haven't gone out of the 8..11 bar range. As expected I get a little longer shots with 8 bar. Mostly I've tried to settle to using 9.5 bars.</li>
<li>Haven't yet tried changing water temperature - it's been 93 degrees C.</li>
<li>I've tried with a 2 second pre-infusion and without. Not much of a difference.</li>
<li>It's worth mentioning that my timings are measured from pulling the lever - but it takes at least 5 seconds for the first drips to appear (about 9 seconds with pre-infusion).</li>
<li>Also worth mentioning is that I'm getting lots of variation from shot to shot with exactly the same settings. Like 31g shot in 22 seconds, and then 34g shot in 17 seconds. This seems to happen more when I go to these finer grind sizes. I suspect uneven extraction.</li>
<li>I have also used 3 different types of coffee beans. No real difference.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the smallest possible grind size, 8 bar pressure and 15g coffee I've managed to get 31g shot in 27 seconds. But it tasted very underextracted.</p>
<p>The best results I've had have been when I've increased dose to 17..18 grams. Then I'm able to also use courser grinds. With these doses I'm finally getting some more crema and the taste is no more watery. Though my basket is pretty-much overflowing at such a large dose.</p>
<p>Most of the espresso-making tutorials I've seen always tend to deal with 18 gram or larger baskets.</p>
<p><strong>So, is there hope in brewing espresso with 14 gram basket (and what should I change)?</strong>
Or should I get myself a 18 gram basket and move on (my portafilter seems to have enough room to put a larger basket in).</p>

The Mazzer SJ produces a nice even grind and is finely adjustable but even after modifying to on-demand single-shot mode it still retains too much. An old La Cimbali Magnum sans hopper was offered at auction and nobody else wanted it so it now graces my bench. What a revolution it is in design, engineering, construction quality and performance.
The conical chute that feeds beans into the burrs, combined with the shape of the grinding chamber allows it to pull in every bean even with only a single-shot dose loaded, and if it takes in 16g of beans it outputs 16g of grounds. Yes it is huge and will be hard to find but after years of testing and comparing espresso equipment I will never look at another grinder again.<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBZSp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>

<p>A longer answer: I was using the black capsuls which are designed for espresso size cup, but ran it twice in Lungo mode, thus I assumed I'm getting a weaker coffee.</p>
<p>However, I started questioning the quality of these capsules after getting a free sample of cocoa capsules. The smell was spot on, but the taste quite lackluster. By an interesting coincidence, I had an actual cocoa bag at home and brew myself a proper cocoa on a stove with milk, and the final result was a night and day to the capsules.</p>
<p>After that, I went to a friend who has the spinning Vertuo machine, which makes coffee designed for bigger cups. Sicne I was deluding mine, I assumed the coffee from that machine will be stronger, but it was quite similar to mine.</p>
<p>Compared to those, the moka pot, like the cocoa, has a proper rich taste and strength. Even when I make it &quot;on the weaker side&quot;, it still beats the capsules by miles, which tastes like coffee dust rather than proper coffee.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying capsules are bad, and I guess they are more tastey than instand coffee, but they don't come any closer to fresh grinded coffee made in a moka pot (like bottled orange juice compared to a freshly squized one).</p>

<p>The machine lets me brew phenomenally delicious espresso with the large double basket, which has straight walls and lets the water flow through the coffee evenly. The espresso has a really nice texture, it's neither sour nor bitter, perfectly balanced, very sweet and just very enjoyable in general.</p>
<p>The single and the small double baskets however only have holes in the middle and are kind of shaped like a funnel. I understand the purpose of this shape, it's to slow the water down so you get similar extraction times with the same grind setting.</p>
<p>During the past few weeks I tried to use the single baskets exclusively to see if I can make single shots instead of having to drink a doppio every time. I have tried adjusting a lot of factors and could not get an espresso that was as good as with the double basket. I tried adjusting temperature, pump pressure, grind size, tamping pressure, and extraction ratio. I have tried using 7,8, and 9 grams of coffee with a brew ratio of 1.8 to 2.5 and none of them were as good as with the double basket.</p>
<p>No matter what I tried, the espresso always had that channeling taste. It was sour and bitter at the same time. Inspecting the pucks afterwards showed no clear sign of channeling most of the time.</p>
<p>After this frustrating ordeal I just went back to using the double basket, which clearly makes better espresso (I even did a blind test to see if I can tell the difference, I got 4 out of 4 right).</p>
<p>Are single baskets just not made for specialty coffee? Does the funnel shape cause circulation at the edges and therefore higher extraction at the edges compared to the middle of the puck? Is it possible to get an espresso from a single basket that is as delicious as one made with a double basket? If not, can I buy a single basket that has the same shape as a double basket but with room for less coffee? I'm already pretty close to the finest grind setting on my grinder so I'm scared that using less coffee would make it flow faster than I can counteract with grinding finer.</p>

<p>If I go finer on the grind, I get more bitterness than I'd like. I'm pretty sure that's mostly due to the inconsistent grind from the encore, but it could also be the uneven extraction from the filter basket itself or my tamping technique.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>No</strong>, do not bother with precision filter baskets. The Baratza Encore is definitely not a grinder for espresso, it is meant for brewing methods which use coarser grinds like filter coffee or French press. It cannot grind fine enough properly - you get an inconsistent grind. Baratza offers the Sette series which grinds fine enough and consistent enough to get good espresso. I really wouldn't recommend buying a high end basket until you have a proper grinder, maybe look for used grinders. I got mine super cheap because it was used and after a proper clean it was almost as good as new.</p>
<p>One rule of thumb when getting into espresso is to spend at least as much on your grinder as you spend on your machine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If so, what are the aspects to look for? What are the models to consider?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you really do want to experiment with a high precision basket, just look for one which fits your portafilter (shouldn't be too hard since you have a standard 58mm one), is big enough for your desired dose, and is from a somewhat reputable brand (and is ideally used by professionals).</p>

<p>As for the hot ears, I get those when I drink something warm like a tea (or coffee) and when I eat something spicy. This also might be a harmless effect of the caffeine.</p>

Then there is the type of coffee bean used and method of roasting which can help deliver the taste you want. This is very similar to how you program a computer changing certain variables leads to a different output. Then there is how the bean is processed to make the grounds used in your coffee. I am a firm believer that you will greatly improve the taste of your coffee if you grind the beans yourself but others have different methods. Lastly, there is how is the coffee made?

<p>With a pressurised filter basket, the resistance is mostly produced by the one tiny hole in the filter basket. For non-pressurised ones, the coffee needs to provide the resistance.</p>
<p>If the grounds fail to provide enough resistance, the water will run through the coffee really fast, probably creating a bunch of channels which you can usually see as little holes in the coffee bed after the extraction. The problem with the channels is that most of the water goes through the channels (over extracting the coffee there) instead of evenly extracting all available grounds.</p>

More specifically, it normally takes a few minutes for it to fully drip out after pouring on the water, but in these cases it takes in excess of ten minutes.

Carbonated cold water provided via SodaStream. Then heated to 200° rapidly on stove. Then added to a measuring device to measure carbonation levels. Or CO2 levels being excreted from the top. As a standard I did this once with regular 200-degree water and ones with carbonated 200-degree water. And both times I let the grinds degress or the gas at the beginning.

I could tell a instant difference in the darkness and richness of the Brew in the carbonated water versus the plane water. Also noted richer taste. After the Brewing process. The carbonated water was no longer carbonated but did extract more from the coffee. Carbonated water is not simply bubbles and how carbonated water works in Brewing process is far different than just blowing bubbles through the grinds. There's interesting interaction that happens when carbonated water touches something course. I got these ideas from watching a detailed video on bubbles and the different kinds and was particularly interested in CO2 carbonation. My next experiment I want to try and add ultrasonic waves or the same technology they use to examine fetus growing. Known as ultrasound being pumped directly through the carbonated water in the time of the coffee grinds. Video I watched adding ultrasonic waves to microscopic carbonated water points causes the bubbles to go from a nice round shape to a rather violent sharp point more like a bracket gear then a perfect sphere.

After a bit of time the caked on and powdered grounds give way and fall down into the stuff you just grounded.

<p>A paper filter will filter the oils in the coffee and give you a &quot;brighter&quot; flavor in your coffee. Filtering the oil out may also change the health factors of drinking coffee, since those oils provide nutrition elements that are both good for you and bad for you.</p>
<p>The metal filter by itself will let oils and fines into your final brew. The oils will make the coffee taste richer and more earthy. The fines (which are dust like fine grinds of coffee) will create some sludge in the final brew. Not a lot probably, but some.</p>
<p>I suggest that if you like how the coffee tastes with a paper filter, keep using a paper filter. And if you want to try without paper, consult the manual first to make absolutely sure this is ok with your machine. I can't tell which model Cooks 12 cup you have, so I don't know if your machine actually has a permanent filter or just a basket.</p>

I'm still getting used to my Moka pot, so its normal that I don't get a new coffee right in the first try, but this one is proving a challenge. No matter what I do, it ends up over-extracted (quite bitter).</p>
<p>My first suspicion is the grind, it doesn't look consistently sized:</p>

After trying different flame sizes (i.e. temperatures) and different amounts of water and seeing no change, I'm wondering if there's something else I should do, or some specific temperature/water level/method I should try - like interrupting the extraction midway with cold water as I've seen some people recommend.</p>
<p>Also, the extraction process is sputtering quite a bit, the coffee goes out on high pressure from the start. Maybe despite most of the coffee being quite coarse, it's still clogging the filter with the smaller particles? I'm definitely not tampering, don't even fill all the way through (like 90% filled).</p>
<p>Is my analysis correct and the grind is the biggest problem, or is there something else I should experiment with my Moka pot that may work? Should I reserve this coffee for some other method like pouring over, or just give up?</p>

5468,2,,2020-12-18T17:55:34.980,1,,"<p>Many of these fully automatic machines heat the milk by combining steam and milk. In my experience, those machines do not take into account the temperature of the milk, they simply mix steam and milk at a fixed ratio. Assuming the steam has a fairly constant temperature, the temperature of the heated milk will mostly depend on the temperature of the cold milk. Simply stated, cooler milk will produce cooler heated milk.</p>
<p>If you use milk straight from the fridge, it might be wise to heat it a bit yourself before passing it through the machine. Microwaving the milk you need to slightly below room temperature and then feeding it through the machine's frothing process should increase the temperature of the heated milk. By extension, the temperature of the final drink will be higher as well.</p>
<p>Be careful not to pre-heat the milk too much, then the machine could heat it so that you get unwanted chemical reactions (e.g. <a href=""https://perfectdailygrind.com/2019/02/what-temperature-should-your-cappuccino-milk-be/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lactose reacting with proteins</a>) or that the final product comes out steaming.</p>

<p>The size of the largest particles in your first picture are French press or even cold-brew worthy: I can see the curved, smooth outside of the beans.

<p>My (very cheap) 4-cup Cuisinart drip-style coffee maker (like the kind you'd find in a hotel) fits the bill for me in most ways: size, ease of use and cleanup, simplicity. I've had more involved ways of making coffee in my life and noticed the joy slip away when I have to work for 30 minutes just to have a nice hot cup before my brain is even awake enough to know the difference.</p>
<p>I only buy light and medium roast single-origin coffees from regions like Guatemala and Ethiopia because they seem to correspond to brighter (read: more acidic) and more fruity flavors, and I grind it myself, albeit with a blade grinder, so I'm fairly certain the beans aren't to blame. Also use a 1:17 by weight ratio of coffee to tap water.</p>
<p>I'm interested to know why the coffee I'm making is so muted compared to the other extraction methods I'm used to (pour over, Aeropress, french press). The cup that comes out of this machine is the opposite of bright and citrusy; more like muddy. It's not terrible, but if I add a pinch of citric acid, it certainly brightens up (though there's no accompanying fruity/citrusy smell).</p>

And the quality of batch brewing machines mostly comes down to the heating element. The best ones I have personally used in cafes and at home is the Technivorm Moccamaster. However if you want to keep using your current machine there are few things you can keep in mind. My first thought is that your quality of grind may produce a lot of fines, leading to a muddy grind even at a coarser setting, however for a batch brew you can go finer than french press. There are also several kinds of acidity that can be present in coffee (chlorogenic, quinic, citric, acetic, lactic, malic, phosphoric, linoleic, and palmitic). It may be you're missing the more lemony or berry notes, which will be easier to taste if it's a natural processed coffee or a variation of honey processed over a fully washed. It could also be age. If a coffee is too fresh, a lot of the flavors get muddled together. If it's too old, the flavor is dry and papery. I personally wait a full week after the roast date before brewing anything. And I recommend only buying coffee that has a roast date on the bag. Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Mochas are latte-based drinks. They use steamed and frothed milk, not just plain milk. Steamed and frothed milk are both produced by mixing air and heat with milk (typically by injecting steam, by heating and agitating, or by a combination of these) to make it creamier. You can make frothed milk without special tools by agitating milk aggressively while heating it on the stove. Use a hand mixer or immersion blender. If you like the effect, you can buy dedicated frother devices for about $30-40 online.</p>

<ol>
<li>Longer brew time. As you said, this is difficult to achieve with a moka pot.</li>
<li>Increased temperature. This is also practically uncontrollable with a moka pot.</li>
<li>Grind finer. This is probably the variable which has the most effect on your brew. If you grind finer, you get more surface area and higher extraction (all else being equal of course). Keep in mind this will make your coffee less acidic but also more bitter.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, a moka pot doesn't allow for much customization and precise adjustments. The only thing I can strongly recommend is to keep everything you're doing the same from brew to brew and only adjust the grind size.</p>
<p>If you don't own a grinder and use pre-ground coffee I'm afraid you're out of luck. Getting a cheap-ish hand grinder (usable and consistent hand grinders are available for 30-50$/€) and using freshly ground beans instead of pre-ground coffee is an upgrade I <em><strong>strongly recommend</strong></em>.</p>

<p>That leaves mostly grind size and to a far lesser degree brewing time as parameters. Aim for a comparatively fine grind - finer than for pour-over, a bit coarser than for espresso.   Try to go down with the grind size until you start to see some dust at the bottom of the upper chamber, but not so fine that it clogs up. As you have a largely fixed and rather short extraction time, coarse ground coffee won’t be extracted well, giving you an under extracted brew.</p>

Meanwhile, the brew temperature of a pour-over or Aeropress made with water fresh off the boil will be much higher, closer to 95°C. Brewing at higher temperatures might be what allows you to get more of the acidity you desire.</p>
<p>Luckily, that same post shows that using hot (45°C) tap water to fill the water tank of the drip machine can help to increase its brewing temperature. With cold water in the tank, it takes a full 6 minutes for the water leaving the shower screen to reach 88°C; with hot tap water instead it takes just 1 minute, and the brew temperature eventually reaches 95°C. Still maybe not as hot as other brewing methods, but perhaps an improvement on what you've got at the moment. Good luck!</p>

<p>A percolator, on the other hand, relies on immersion to brew. Water is heated in the sealed lower chamber and converted to steam. Pressure builds until enough pressure is reached to push steam up into the brew basket at top. There, the steam mixes with coffee and condenses, and brewing occurs. When enough water reaches the upper chamber, coffee brew drips back down to the lower chamber, where the water content can be converted back to steam to support indefinite brewing.</p>

<p>By reheating your kettle between pours you introduce another variable which can mess with the consistency of your brew. The reason we measure everything when brewing coffee is to be able to isolate a single variable, adjust it, and determine its impact on the taste of the brew. Consistency is the most important thing here.
Losing one or two degrees in your kettle while brewing shouldn't have much of an impact on the taste of your brew if it happens consistently. Also, the water drops in temperature significantly when it reaches the grounds, as explained in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_r5kpXPRYo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">James's video</a> you probably meant.</p>
<p>Both James Hoffmann and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B02U5ZqJhM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Matt Perger</a> recommend using boiling water for brewing because seeing water bubble (and therefore knowing it's exactly 100°C) is more reliable than having a thermometer telling you the temperature. &quot;25 degree water looks exactly the same as 85 degree water&quot;.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to let the water come to a boil and as soon as it starts boiling, start your brew and don't reheat it between pours. Even though the water might cool down a little, it will do so similarly from brew to brew. If you reheat your kettle between pours, you'll have to put in on the stove the exact same way each time, which is difficult (maybe not difficult but surely finicky) to achieve, especially if you have a pour-over to worry about.</p>
<p>Now, before anyone comments with &quot;100°C is too hot, you'll burn the coffee&quot;:</p>
<p>Coffee is roasted at temperatures around and above 200°C, you're not burning anything.</p>
<p>&quot;It will taste burnt and bitter because the bitter compounds will be extracted more easily.&quot;</p>

5499,2,,2021-01-14T11:52:54.823,1,,"<p>What's strange is that the post you link to describes full immersion as falling under the category of 'pour-over techniques'. Typically it's more common to think of two categories, percolation and immersion. Percolation covers everything involving water being pushed through a bed of coffee - so low-pressure percolation would be something like a Chemex or V60 pour-over, and a high-pressure percolation could be something like espresso. Meanwhile, immersion brewing covers French presses, cold brew, cupping preparation, Turkish coffee etc. where the coffee grounds sit in some water for a while, and then we use some method - the mesh in a French press or the steady hand of someone preparing Turkish coffee - to separate the grounds after. Some brewing methods blur the line between these two categories, like the Aeropress or the Clever dripper, which immerse coffee grounds in water for a period of time, and then use some mechanism to percolate the water through the grounds. Given all this, describing a 'full immersion' brew as a type of pour-over method is... weird.</p>
<p>It seems like what the linked post describes as a 'full immersion' pour-over is essentially a bad or failed pour-over. In a pour-over, what we want to do is have a steady flow of water through the bed of coffee, and we use things like water temperature, brew time, grind size, grind dose, etc. to control the level of extraction in our brew. Too little extraction means a dull, boring cup of coffee; too much extraction can produce lots of bitterness or acidity or nasty flavours in the cup.</p>
<p>Sometimes in a pour-over brew, for whatever reason - perhaps the grinds were too fine and clogged the filter paper, or perhaps the filter stuck to the brewing vessel and created a vacuum - the brew will stall and fail to draw down like it normally would. This increases our brew time and can lead to over-extraction with lots of bitter notes - which the post describes as 'unpleasant taste components'. It seems like this 'Osmotic Flow' is basically a bunch of tips for avoiding a stalled pour-over brew: try not to disturb the bed of coffee too much with rapid or heavy pouring, use a bloom phase, pour in batches instead of all at once, and so on. All good tips - but certainly not a new brewing method.</p>
<p>In short, then: percolation is one of the two main families of brew methods, alongside immersion brewing. A sub-category of percolation are pour-over methods - things like the V60, Chemex, etc. This 'Osmotic Flow' method doesn't seem to be a method at all; instead, it's a set of tips for how to have a good pour-over and avoid the common problem of a stalled brew. Helpful - but not a new method!</p>

Though not every COVID-19 case has this symptom, it's a very specific symptom that doesn't commonly have other causes. This question is about the suitability of coffee beans as a low cost testing tool for COVID-19. I'm interested in exploring this as <a href=""https://twitter.com/brunobowden/status/1343934162223284226?s=20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I lead development</a> of the WHO COVID-19 app.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Odds Ratio</a> for a person reporting loss of taste or smell was reported as 6.7 through the COVID Symptom Study in their Nature research paper: <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Real-time tracking of self-reported symptoms to predict potential COVID-19</a>.

The question is whether adding a specific daily smell test using coffee beans would be worthwhile?</p>
<p>The general thought is to have a cup of coffee beans that you smell on a daily basis. Then report in the app if you had a loss of smell. The ideal test is fast, cheap and easy. To be fast, the container may need to be open so you don't have the daily irritation of having to remove a sealed lid. I considered a coffee bean as I thought they'd be cheap and available around the world.</p>
<p>If you'll excuse multiple questions, I have some specific areas I was looking for feedback on....</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How to get consistency in smell? Smell decay curve for coffee beans. How quickly does open coffee beans lose their smell? How does an open / closed container impact this? How often might you need to replace the beans due to smell decay, mold or other reasons?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cost of coffee beans. How widely available and affordable are they in some of the poorest communities in the world?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any other product that you think that could be more effective. It needs to be an existing widely available low cost product.</p>

<p>Ok, settings are 93 degrees on the PID, grind around 3 (a nudge above). 15.5g ground beans in for 30s/ 30g out. No tamping, only distributing with a distributer. Backpressure sits around 11 bar at the end of the green zone on the gauge.</p>

5517,2,,2021-01-23T15:52:39.207,-1,,"<p>Fresh coffee is neither widely available nor inexpensive in all places. Coffee in Japan is relatively expensive because demand is relatively (extremely) low compared to western nations. I think I remember my coworkers also telling me that fresh coffee in India is almost never used because most Indians so drink coffee prefer instant. I wouldn't trust availability of coffee for this kind of test, but it also can't hurt to include it in the app as an option for people who can get fresh coffee.</p>
<p>I say fresh coffee because instant coffee in my experience doesn't have a strong smell in the first place.</p>
<p>About smell decay, that depends on a wide range of factors such as time since roasting at time of sale, quality of beans, conditions of storage, and qualities of packaging. My experience with cheap coffees is that they tend to be sold preground (which will lose scents faster than whole bean), though this will not be true in all countries or even all regions within a country.</p>
<p>Does it even matter though? My interpretation of the &quot;loss of smell&quot; symptom of COVID, having not experienced it myself, is literally a complete loss of smell. It would be far more reliable to advise acquiring a new bag of coffee and seeing if you can smell it.</p>
<p>Then again, there are loads of more economical options. Basically every spice under the sun (onion powder, garlic powder, curry powder, chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, thyme, rosemary, etc.), aromatic vegetables like onions and garlic, vinegar, fish or fish oil, and other aromatic foods might be more widely available at lower prices than coffee in most places.</p>

<p>Start tamping your coffee. Without tamping channels form a lot easier, making your shot pour a lot faster and making your coffee taste sour and bitter at the same time. If you still manage to get 11 bars of pressure somehow without tamping, I'd assume your coffee is ground way too fine anyways, making it even more likely to form channels since they offer less resistance than the puck itself.</p>
<p>The fact that the first shot flows slower than the second one probably boils (no pun intended) down to a colder brew head.

<p>Beans are sometimes marketed as &quot;espresso blends&quot; based on the roasting quality (usually quite dark) and origin blends. Of course, preground espresso blends typically are sold very finely ground--perfect for espresso machines.</p>
<p>If your &quot;espresso blend&quot; was ground coarsely enough to be used in a French press, yes, you can brew it in the French press. Of course the resulting brew will not taste like espresso. It will taste like French press with a dark roast. Your mileage may vary depending on the actual fineness of the grind (i.e., it may not actually be fine enough for French press even if it is much to coarse for espresso).</p>

<li>instant coffee (which feels fake like boiled water).</li>
</ul>
<p>I am tired of all so these failed attempts, so I go to Costa everyday and I always have a latte. There’s something about them that make coffee so good and alive.
How can I get that without being too expensive? But without compromising on taste? In short, why do those coffee shops have such amazing coffee?</p>

5536,2,,2021-02-05T07:10:15.567,2,,"<p>I'm not familiar with Costa, but I am with Starbucks. Let me offer my ideas in what's different.</p>
<p>Starbucks stores use fully automatic espresso machines with semi automatic frothing wands. The espresso machines make true espresso, unlike all of the brewing options you mentioned. This is the main reason the coffee is better.</p>
<p>The frothing wand also uses steam to froth the milk which creates a wonderfully creamy texture in the milk. Stick and pitcher frothers can't make the performance.</p>
<p>There's also grind. Starbucks stores use high quality coffee grinders that grind the coffee quite consistently. Coffee used for espresso is ground on demand for each shot. Your coffee at home might suffer if you're not grinding right before your brew or if you're grinding with a lower quality grinder.</p>
<p>Lastly, drink recipes. Starbucks cups are printed with volume markers to help baristas match recipes exactly. When you buy a latte at Starbucks, the ratio of espresso to milk is ideal and is the same every time. Unless you're measuring at home and know what that ideal ratio is, you're likely not hitting the right recipe.</p>
<p>To get coffee shop type lattes at home, you need a real espresso machine. A single boiler unit with a steam wand will do the trick, but nothing short of one will.</p>

5537,2,,2021-02-05T07:39:55.343,0,,"<p>The only thing you haven’t tried according to your list is genuine <strong>espresso with steamed milk</strong>.</p>
<p>The standard coffee chain menu is based on espresso shots and steamed milk, in various ratios, and perhaps some flavor syrups.</p>
<ul>
<li>The coffees types you mentioned are all “thinner”, i.e. with a higher water-to-coffee ratio (the nespresso is probably closest to a true espresso) and without the “fullness” of an espresso.<br />
Plus, the beans should be ground fresh for each shot, which means you get the maximum flavor kick from them.</li>
<li>The second factor is the milk. The steaming process creates a certain mouthfeel based on tiny, rather stable bubbles in the milk that tell your taste buds “creamy”.</li>
</ul>
<p>You need the comparatively strong / dark espresso as a counterpart, otherwise the milk will make the coffee seem bland, that’s why the coffee chains’ espresso roasts are quite dark.</p>
<p>So if you want a coffe-chain drink, you need</p>
<ul>
<li>A dark / espresso roast of at least average quality (the chains’ coffee is not exactly top notch, but good enough for latte-type of drinks). The milk will dull many of the finer notes of top quality espresso. You could even try the chains’ own coffee, which is usually also sold in the stores. Just make sure you get the espresso roast.</li>
<li>A decent burr grinder than can go low enough for espresso. Burr because espresso needs a very homogeneous grind and you need to do a bit of research as different grinders have a different grind spectrum.</li>
<li>An espresso machine. Not a “stovetop espresso machine” aka a Moka, and as you found, a Nespresso doesn’t work for your taste.</li>
<li>A way to froth the milk, usually a steam wand is part of the espresso machine. It may be a good idea to watch a few videos of how to properly steam the milk, as it’s a major factor for the mouthfeel and ultimately taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to break the bank, you should get decent (or “coffee shop”) quality with the setup above and good technique. It’s an investment upfront, but over time, the coffee shop stops add up as well. You may also consider a fully automated machine, but not only are the good ones quite expensive, you are also quite limited in how to adjust to your liking. You may want to try them out somewhere before buying. (I’m personally also not a fan because cleaning them can be quite a pain-in-the-you-know-what and depending on how much you use them, in my opinion not worth it.)</p>

'Espresso beans', as noted above, refers mainly to the roast (a longer, darker one that yields a fuller flavour, more body, low acidity, and slighty less caffeine, which is degraded by the extra heat), though an 'espresso blend' may also be heavier on robusta and lighter on arabica, as the latter's acids and aromas are also sensitive to longer thermal exposure.  Coarse grinds are actually the most appropriate for French presses.  An 'espresso grind' (super-fine, second only to Turkish) would clog the mesh and make a muddy confection that is, well, not what the designers of French presses had in mind.  So you've got nice, user-friendly tech, the right grind for it, and a tasty roast.  Espresso is made with espresso machines, but great coffee has no limits on the sorts of equipment from which it is willing to emerge.</p>

5547,2,,2021-02-18T18:45:23.347,1,,"<p><strong>I have the answer!</strong></p>
<p>Like many others, the gasket (O-ring washer thing) on my trusty moka pot was starting to disintegrate after years of stove-top brews. I carefully checked the size I needed and ordered a pack off Amazon. After popping a new gasket in I got the sputtering, mostly steam, small fraction of a brew that so many others describe. Same scenario of misbehavior detailed here and elsewhere. The problem is described everywhere with irritable, coffee-deprived fervor.</p>
<p>Potential culprits included:</p>
<ul>
<li>wrong gasket size</li>
<li>bent basket (that holds the grounds)</li>
<li>coffee packed in too tight</li>
<li>faulty safety valve</li>
<li>clogs in filter or funnel</li>
<li>heat too high</li>
<li>and others I'm forgetting</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's possible any of those issues can still be a problem, I found the solution to be far simpler: <strong>screw the moka pot together more tightly</strong>. Literally, when screwing together the top half and bottom half (at the gasket seal), close it more tightly while the gasket is new. I had closed it tightly but brew after brew was getting the same problem but then I tried closing it as tightly as I could and voila!</p>
<p>The thing is, when the gasket is new, the rubber is overly firm from the factory. Even if you think you screwed the moka pot together tightly, the new gasket is not molding to the hairline space between the gasket and moka pot. You gotta screw it together tighter in the beginning while the gasket is still new. As the heat and repeated brews loosen up the rubber the seal will become more forgiving and you wont need to tighten as much. But in the beginning you gotta break in the rubber. Only downside is it can be difficult to take apart.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr- screw moka pot together more tightly while gasket is new. The rubber is too stiff. Screw it tight and then screw it some more. In time the rubber will be more forgiving.</strong></p>

By only letting the finer particles reach the paper, what you are doing is actually clogging the paper faster, because all those very fine particulates can find every tiny space unhindered by the deposition of larger particles, which would get in the way. A mix of different size particles should clog less and also be easier to rinse of. I suggest you do the following experiment: time every coffee extraction with your normal method (two filters) until you decide it is time to dispose of the paper filter (let's say 5 extractions). Then do the same number of extractions on just a paper filter having gently rinsed the filter between uses and compare the extraction times. If you get faster extractions on just paper, that means the filter is less clogged, and therefore, the coffee you are brewing is less affected by leftover old coffee. If not, then you are doing the right thing. You should do this over the course of as many days as it takes you to normally change filters so that the effects of &quot;ageing&quot; debris in the filter can happen.</p>
